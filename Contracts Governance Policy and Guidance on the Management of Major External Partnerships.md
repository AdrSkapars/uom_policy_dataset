# The University of Manchester Contracts Governance Policy

1. Introduction

The University of Manchester ('the University') (which includes its subsidiaries) routinely enters into a wide variety of contracts in relation to, for example:

- Research, Collaborations etc.
- Estates
- Finance
- Employment
- Procurement
- Students
- Grants (sub-contracts)
- Consultancies
- IT

Such arrangements can, either individually or taken as a whole, have a material effect on the financial / legal exposure and operations of the University.

The purpose of this document is to record the University’s procedures and responsibilities in relation to entering into, and compliance with, contracts (excluding gifts and donations).

All University staff are required to comply with this Policy.

The General Counsel is responsible for legal matters in the University and as such he (or nominee) shall be consulted on major issues relating to external contacts, as defined below, and will oversee the provision of legal advice in relation to the areas covered by this Policy.

2. Guiding Principles

In establishing this Policy, the following guiding principles apply throughout the University (including UMI3 and other subsidiaries):

1. All contracts must have a clear rationale.
2. All contracts must be appropriately reviewed through this Policy by the applicable professional team (for example, HR, Estates, Procurement, Contracts Team, Legal, Finance, Research Governance, IT, Information Governance Office) before signature.
3. All contracts must be properly approved according to University’s applicable Finance Regulations, principles of sustainability, and other governing documents. When applicable the ‘Management of External Partnerships’ Procedure (see Appendix 1) should be followed. Appendix 2 summarises the approval process.
4. All contracts must be signed only by an approved signatory, either under hand or under seal.
5. All contracts must have a clear “owner” (for example a PSS function, or where Faculty-based, responsible Academic e.g. Principal Investigator).
6. The responsible owner is responsible for ensuring compliance with the contract.
# Specific Contracts

|1. Research, Collaborations.|All Research contracts and collaborations are the responsibility of the Contracts Team, Research and Business Engagement Support Services (and must be handled, approved, and signed by the Research and Business Engagement Support Services ('RBESS')).|
|---|---|
|2. Estates.|All matters relating to Estates (including purchase / sale / lease; construction; surveying; title; refurbishments) are the responsibility of the Directorate of Estates and Facilities.|
|3. Finance.|Finance has a critical role to play in ensuring that the financial aspects of all contracts (including profit / loss analysis; fEC analysis; financial projections; cashflow analysis; tax; compliance with Financial Regulations) are adhered to. Finance is specifically responsible for relationships with banks and associated borrowing and other financial arrangements.|
|4. Employment.|HR is responsible for all aspects of employment and staff related contracts.|

# Contracts Negotiation and Approvals

As noted above, all contracts must be properly approved before signature. Appendix 2 outlines approval processes and limits. Further advice can be sought from the Directorate of Finance.

# Compliance

As noted above, compliance with contracts is an essential part of ensuring that the University gain appropriate value and avoids adverse consequences. There must be a continuing chain of compliance, particularly where for example contract owners leave the University or transfer to other roles. Where this happens, it is a line management responsibility to ensure that refreshed compliance arrangements are put in place, including the appointment of a new owner. The same applies in respect of key support functions (e.g. Finance/RBESS/Contracts Team/Office of the General Counsel/IGO) where such functions are closely involved with continuing compliance. It is the role of Compliance & Risk and UNIAC from time to time to conduct audits into compliance with this Policy, and to report accordingly.

# Contracts Archiving / Retention

Responsibilities for archiving / retention are as follows:
# Contracts Archiving Responsibilities

|1.|For contracts which are the direct responsibility of a PSS Directorate, that Directorate is responsible for ensuring that all contracts are appropriately archived/stored and logged so as to be readily available.|
|---|---|
|2.|The responsibility for ensuring that all Faculty/School-based grants are appropriately archived/stored and logged so as to be readily available rests with the appropriate Faculty.|
|3.|For research contracts, RBESS are responsible for ensuring that all contracts are appropriately archived / stored and logged so as to be readily available.|

In all cases, contracts should be retained in original form in accordance with the University’s Records Retention Schedule: http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=6514.

# MANAGEMENT OF MAJOR EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS

# SENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM PROCEDURE

Introduction

This Procedure describes how certain business proposals, involving the University and its subsidiaries
(e.g. MBSW), should be progressed at Senior Leadership Team (SLT) level. As such it is an operational
document for guidance. Other governance processes and approvals may apply, and this document
does not alter or displace them. Major External Partnerships are defined for these purposes as those
with significant strategic implications, with major University costs and/or assets implications, with
potentially significant risks and liabilities, with sensitivities (e.g. for other funders, students, staff) or
with outcomes that may have significant financial or reputational impact. A value of £5M+ will
normally fall to be considered under this Procedure.

In general, partnerships that involve multiple parts of the University, even where costs are more
modest, should follow the process below.

Context

We aim to increase our engagement in major external partnerships with companies, universities,
government (local, national, transnational e.g. EU), charities and donors and other organisations.
These are likely to be increasingly complex, involving multiple partners, in the UK and overseas,
especially as UK government funding declines. We need to be particularly focussed and well
prepared to meet the diverse challenges posed, and to ensure that partnerships we enter into are
successful in terms of shared expectations and the delivery of outcomes.

The key features of success (for us and others) include:

- A clear and articulated strategic as well as operational ‘fit’ in the context of the University’s
mission and objectives.
- Identification of a clear champion on the SLT.
- Formulation of a detailed business case and plan with clear deliverables, milestones and
costed exit arrangements.
- Development of clear lines of communication within the University and with partners.
- Shared goals and objectives that are fully owned and understood by all partners.
- An agreed structure for management and monitoring progress including lines of
responsibility and accountability and links to our own internal structures.
- Early identification of risks and processes for their mitigation.
- Engagement with relevant parts of the University at a sufficiently early stage to ensure
commitment.
- Clear policy on contingencies, changes in direction and exit strategy.
- Positive, managed external announcement and communications strategy.
# Process

The applicable SLT member (‘the Sponsor’) should notify the President & Vice-Chancellor in advance of proposals which may fall within this procedure. The SLT Sponsor will refer on any projects considered to the relevant Committee for approval – CPSC for capital expenditure, FSC for revenue expenditure and if >£10m to Finance Committee. Should the collaboration involve IT expenditure, whether capital or revenue, approval of CITPC is required.

For any of these (prior to signing of any contracts):

Early engagement of SLT is essential to give approval to proceed, with a specific Sponsor on SLT as above.Governance, management and reporting structures to be agreed by SLT, and regular reports given to SLT on progress.Governance will usually include establishment of a Project Team with relevant functions represented.All major legal contracts must have an appointed project champion and should be discussed with the General Counsel, the Director of Finance, the Contracts Office and other relevant functions, as appropriate, early in the process.Proposed business case (covering all aspects including Finance, Estates, HR, Legal, Intellectual Property) to be reviewed at Finance Sub-Committee and PRC. May for complex arrangements include a project manager/team. See attached ‘Business Case for Review’.The external partnership may also need approval by the Board of Governors, at the discretion of the President & Vice-Chancellor.Time needs to be built in for handling of complex agreements, while recognising that expediency may be required in some cases.All contractual arrangements must comply with the University’s Contracts Governance Policy. This procedure for Major External Partnerships supplements and is complementary to that Policy.

Note: Proposals may have to be considered on a paper basis if Committee meetings are not in synch.
