# Extended Access to emails and e-resources Policy for Research Staff

# Introduction

Extended Access Policy for Research Staff

This is a joint initiative developed by the University’s Research Staff Association and the University to extend access to email accounts and e-resources for a period of 12 months beyond the termination date of research employment contracts linked to finite funding.

Following a successful pilot scheme this policy was formally adopted in April 2013.

# Aims

It is designed to contribute to mitigating the negative effects of the instability of fixed term employment contracts for researchers, in line with the overarching commitments the University has signed up to in the “Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers” and the actions published in its “Concordat Implementation Plan”.

Retention of email and e-resource access during the “between contracts” period is crucial in order to maintain contact with the research and teaching community as individuals prepare for interviews and finalize manuscripts from their work.

# Eligibility

This policy applies to all members of research staff leaving the University whose fixed term or open-ended contract linked to finite funding is ending.

Who is not eligible?

- Anyone who is not a member of research staff – for example fixed-term teaching only positions, temporary lecturers, etc. are not eligible under this policy.
- Members of research staff who resign.
- Members of research staff who are dismissed as a consequence of disciplinary action.

# Extended Access Policy for Research Staff

How to obtain Extended Access

Research staff will not automatically be given extended access but must opt into this service.

At six months and three months prior to the contract termination date, HR Services will write to all eligible research staff whose role has been linked to finite funding to offer them the opportunity to benefit from continued access for a period of 12 months.

Research staff must respond by email to HR Services to confirm that they wish to opt into this service should their contract end.
