# Public Service Leave Policy

# 1 Introduction

1.1 This policy sets out the provision for time off to support staff engaged in voluntary public service roles. Social responsibility is at the heart of the University’s strategic vision. We support and encourage staff to contribute their skills and knowledge to make a difference in our local communities and wider society.

# 2 Scope

2.1 This policy is applicable to all staff at the University who wish to carry out a voluntary public service role, regardless of length of service. If a member of staff is unsure whether a public service which they perform is covered by this policy, they should contact HRServices@manchester.ac.uk.

2.2 This policy does not form part of any contract of employment and may be amended at any time.

# 3 Roles and Responsibilities

3.1 It is the responsibility of staff to apply for public service leave in accordance with this policy and where required, provide the relevant supporting information.

3.2 It is the responsibility of managers to consider and approve leave in accordance with this policy, recording public service leave, as well to addressing any relevant operational implications of the leave.

# 4 Time off for Voluntary Public Service roles

4.1 Staff have a statutory right to a reasonable amount of unpaid leave to undertake the public duties listed within this section.

# Public Service Leave Policy

|4.2|Time off is given to enable attendance at meetings of the body or its committees or sub-committees to a member of staff who is a:|
|---|---|
| |• Magistrate / Justice of the Peace|
| |• member of a local authority/ local councillor|
| |• member of a statutory tribunal (e.g. an employment tribunal)|
| |• member of a health authority|
| |• member of the managing or governing body of an educational establishment (see separate guidance for School Governors).|
| |• member of the Environment Agency|
| |• member of a Prison Independent Monitoring Board|
| |• member of a Water Customer Consultation Panel|
| |• a trade union member for trade union duties (the University also has a separate facilities agreement in relation to time off for trade union duties).|
| |• member of such other bodies as may be approved by the President and Vice-Chancellor.|

4.3 Time off will only be granted for attendance at and travel to and from meetings, not for any preparatory work that needs to be undertaken. Staff may be required to produce relevant documentation verifying their public duty appointment.

4.4 Expenses relating to travel and/or subsistence will not be paid by the University.

4.5 Staff cannot claim time off in lieu or payment from the University for any public duties performed out of normal working hours.

4.6 Whilst there is no legal obligation to grant paid leave for these purposes, the University recognises the value of such work and will provide a reasonable amount of this leave with pay. However:

- where a public duty attracts a fee or an allowance the member of staff must declare this. Where the fee paid is equal to or greater than a days’ pay, unpaid leave will be given in relation to the public duty; where the fee is less than a days’ pay, salary will be reduced accordingly.

# Public Service Leave Policy

• whenever possible staff should claim reimbursements for loss of earnings and salary will be reduced accordingly.

|4.7|Staff wishing to undertake a role covered by this policy should initially discuss this with their manager, provide an estimate of the amount of time off required per year to undertake the role and complete a pro-forma in accordance with the Policy on Outside Work and Consultancy (apart from trade union roles where this is not required) to ensure that due consideration is given to potential conflicts of interest.|
|---|---|
|4.8|After discussion, the manager will confirm the maximum amount of leave which may be taken during the year and the maximum amount of that leave that will be paid. This will depend on the requirements for the performance of the duties involved, the time off already permitted to an individual, and the effect of such absence on the effective running of the School/other organisational unit concerned, whilst recognising that staff have a statutory right to a reasonable amount of unpaid leave in these circumstances. The maximum amount of time off work for such public service (paid or unpaid) will not normally exceed 18 days in any rolling 12 month period. In many cases the leave required will be much less, for example School Governors will be given a maximum of 4 or 5 days paid leave (see separate School Governor Guidance.)|
|4.9|Staff wishing to take further time off for such duties will be required to use their normal annual leave.|
|4.10|Staff who are standing for election as a local councillor are expected to take any time spent campaigning leading up to an election as annual leave.|
|4.11|All public service leave allocations will be pro rata for part-time staff.|
|4.12|Staff must give as much notice as possible of leave requests, and all requests must be agreed in advance by their manager, noting that such agreement will not be unreasonably withheld.|
|4.13|Managers should keep a local record of leave requests and outcomes. There is provision for this to be recorded within absence and annual leave records.|
|4.14|Where unpaid leave is granted the manager must inform HR Services who will write to the member of staff to confirm the deduction of pay and will adjust their pay accordingly.|

|5|UK Volunteer Reserve Armed Forces|
|---|---|
|5.1|The following only applies to staff who are members of the UK Reserve Forces (the Territorial Army, Royal Navy Reserve, Royal Marines Reserve or Royal Auxiliary Air Force). The University understands that such staff may be called up at any time to be deployed on full-time operations, and are expected to attend regular training.|
|5.2|Most reserved forces training takes place in the evenings and at weekends, however volunteers are usually expected to attend an annual camp. In order to support staff to undertake this, the University will provide 2 weeks paid leave in addition to normal annual leave. However, as Reservists are paid by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for all training, staff must declare their pay and provide supporting documentation to HR Services. Where the MoD pay is equal to or greater than their normal pay, unpaid leave will be given and where the MoD pay is less than their normal pay, salary will be reduced accordingly.|
|5.3|Should the Reservist be mobilised (i.e. called up for active service) they must give the University as much notice as possible. It is possible for the University to apply to delay or cancel mobilisation if it would seriously harm the business. Details can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/employee-reservist/mobilisation.|
|5.4|During any period of mobilisation Reservists will be paid by and be given a period of annual leave by the MoD. They will therefore be on unpaid leave from the University and will not accrue annual leave or continuous service, although the period before and after the mobilisation will be joined together and treated as continuous.|
|5.5|Annual leave accrued prior to going on a combat tour should wherever possible be taken during the same holiday year, either prior to or after the individual’s mobilisation. If it is not possible for a member of staff to take all of their accrued leave within the holiday year, they can, by agreement with their manager, carry over up to 5 days (one week) untaken leave into the next holiday year. In exceptional cases, for example, if called up at extremely short notice, the University will allow the member of staff to carry over all untaken leave into the next holiday year.|
|5.6|Employer pension contributions will be paid by the MoD and the individual’s contributions will be deducted from salary paid by the MoD.|

5.7 Financial assistance is available to help the University with replacement costs. Further details can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/employee-reservist/financial-support-for-employers

5.8 After mobilisation, the member of staff must notify their manager in writing as soon as they know when they can return to work. This must be no later than the third Monday after their last day of service. The University must re-employ them as soon as it is able to.

5.9 The member of staff has a right to return to their previous post. If this is not possible they will be redeployed to an alternative role on terms and conditions no less favourable than if they had not been absent.

5.10 On return to work after mobilisation, a return to work interview should be held by the manager with the member of staff, using the checklist provided in appendix 1.

# Time-off for Jury Service

6.1 Jury service is usually for a period of 2 weeks (although this can vary).

6.2 When a member of staff is called for jury service they must notify their manager. In exceptional circumstances the manager can ask the individual to try to delay their jury service if their absence would seriously harm the University. The member of staff would need a letter from the manager explaining why. The member of staff can only delay jury service once in a 12-month period, and must say on the jury summons when they’ll be available.

6.3 After the member of staff has responded to the initial notification from the court, they will receive confirmation of the details of their jury service. They must complete form JS1 - Notice of Jury Service and either take or send this together with the confirmation letter from the Courts Service and the certificate of loss of earnings to HR Services. This should be done at the earliest opportunity.

6.4 HR Services will complete and return the certificate of loss of earnings. The individual’s pay will be reduced for each day of jury service by the amount which the member of staff can claim from the court for loss of earnings. In order to alleviate financial difficulties, upon request, the

# Public Service Leave Policy

University will provide a temporary loan to cover loss of earnings which will be repayable as soon as the jury service has finished. Details can be found in form JS1.

# 6.5 Staff must attend work on any whole days that they are not required in court and inform HR Services. Staff are not required to return to work if the court sends them home during the day. The member of staff must inform HR Services when their jury service is complete and they return to work using form JS2.

Further information on jury service is available at: https://www.gov.uk/jury-service/overview

# 7 Attending Magistrate or Crown Courts as a witness

7.1 Staff will be given time off to carry out their public duty when summoned to attend a Magistrate or Crown court as a witness to criminal proceedings (this does not include attendance at Employment Tribunals or Family Courts). They must notify their manager and either take or send the papers received from the Courts Service to HR Services. This should be done at the earliest opportunity.

7.2 The individual’s pay will be reduced by the amount which can be claimed by the member of staff from the courts for loss of earnings.

7.3 Staff attending court as a witness in the course of their duties for the University will receive normal pay.

|Following a period of mobilisation it is important to ensure that the member of staff is supported back into work.
