# MANCHESTER University Collections Policy 1824

The University of Manchester

# 1. Introduction

The University has significant holdings of art, artefacts and archives. These are primarily in four groups:

- 1. The Manchester Museum, the Whitworth Art Gallery, Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre
- 2. The Special Collections of the University of Manchester Library (of which the John Rylands Library is a part);
- 3. Tabley House;
- 4. The University Collections.

Each of these groups maintains policies and procedures relating to the management of their collections and each has separate governance and approval processes. The Special Collections of the University of Manchester Library is the designated repository for the corporate archives of the University and of its constituent units.

This policy relates solely to the University Collections, which are defined in section 2.

# 2. The University Collections

The University Collections consist primarily of artefacts, art and a small amount of archival material across the University which relate to the history of the University as an organisation. They are cared for separately to the Cultural Institutions and the Special Collections of the University of Manchester Library.

This policy covers the University Collections. It:

- Defines the scope of the University Collections;
- Outlines the structures of management and governance for the University Collections;
- Details the processes relating to acquisitions, disposal, transfer, storage, movement, conservation, display, and loans.

# 3. Purpose of the University Collections

The University Collections relate to the history of the University as an organisation, its teaching and research, its people and community and objects which the University has acquired. The University Collections are comprised of our tangible heritage and support the University’s strategic aims by:

- Representing our unique and distinctive place in history;
- Representing our achievements;
- Manifesting our sense of pride and collective identity;
- Demonstrating the historical landscape to our liberal and progressive ethos, traditions and connections to the city and region.

University Collections Policy June 2016
# 3. Definition and scope of the University Collections

The University Collections compromise of thousands of items of art, artefacts and archival objects. The University Collections do not include any objects held by the Special Collections of the University of Manchester Library, the Cultural Institutions or Tabley House. The University Collections are managed as a single group with slightly different processes for the two notional branches of the University Collections:

|1. The University Heritage Collection|primarily relates to the corporate history of the University and consists of objects held in shared and administrative spaces. The Collection includes ceremonial and decorative objects, artworks, photographs and items of outstanding importance to the University’s history and reputation. It includes objects without a direct connection to the University’s history where the item has been purchased or bequeathed.|
|---|---|
|2. The University Faculty and Residence Collections|relate to the history of faculties, schools, residences or other organisational units and their history. These collections encompass, but are not limited to, ceremonial and decorative objects, artworks, photographs and other items of historical or scholarly interest related to the units.|

Items in either collection may:

- Relate to predecessor institutions or structures;
- Be inside or outside buildings;
- Be located off the University’s Estate, if an item is on loan to other organisations.

# 4. Governance and management of the University Collections

Responsibility for the University Collections rests with the University History and Heritage Strategy Group (UHHSG). The UHHSG escalates matters to, and is accountable to, the Planning and Resources Committee (PRC). Where necessary and appropriate, the UHHSG will escalate matters concerning the University Collections to the PRC.

The UHHSG invests the University Historian and Heritage Manager (UHHM) with day-to-day management and authority over the University Collections within the parameters set out in this policy. Over and above the parameters set out in this policy, the UHHM will escalate to the UHHSG any matters where is seems appropriate and necessary to do so. The UHHM will provide an annual report on the University Collections to the UHHSG.

University Historian & Heritage Manager

University Heritage Collection

University Faculties & Residences Collections

The University Historian and Heritage Manager (UHHM) oversees the management of, and has authority over, the University Collections through two processes - one for the University Heritage Collections and another for the University Faculties and Residences Collections.

The University Heritage Collection is directly managed by the UHHM. The UHHM will:

- Ensure the University Heritage Collections are managed and care for in accordance with this policy;
- Conduct periodic reviews of the Collection;
- Arrange specialist advice and services where necessary for the care and conservation of the Collection;
- Consider requests for acquisitions, disposal, storage, movement, conservation, display, and loans according to the parameters set out in section 5;
- Provide an annual report to the University History and Heritage Strategy Group.

The University Faculty and Residences Collections are routinely administered by a nominated individual in the respective unit. The directors of faculty administration, residential services or other appropriate heads of administration are responsible for nominating an appropriate individual. The nominated individual will:

- Receive an induction from the UHHM on their respective collection(s) and the processes for their care and management;

University Collections Policy

June 2016
• Liaise regularly with the UHHM and escalate matters appropriately;

• Work with the UHHM to ensure that their respective collections are managed and cared for in accordance with this policy;

• Be the first point of contact within their respective unit regarding acquisitions, disposal, storage, movement, conservation, display, and loans;

• Conduct period reviews of the collections as agreed with the UHHM;

• Provide an annual report on their collections to the UHHM.

The nominated individual need not have heritage or curatorial expertise, but should be sufficiently familiar with their respective collection(s) to be able to respond to its needs and be appropriately responsible. The nominated individual will liaise regularly with the UHHM for guidance and advice.

The UHHM will consider and agree acquisitions, disposals, storage arrangements, movement, conservation work, displays and loans within the following parameters:

- The process adheres to appropriate sector standards;
- Appropriate specialist advice has been sought where appropriate;
- Each object in the process is not valued at greater than £100,000;
- All loans out are to accredited museums or galleries and can provide appropriate insurance documents and facilities reports;
- The process will not have a detrimental impact on the University’s key historic or cultural spaces or the decorative fabric of the Estate.

All acquisitions, disposals, transfers, storage arrangements, movements, conservation work, displays and loans outside the above parameters will be escalated to the University History and Heritage Strategy Group (UHHSG) for consideration. Where appropriate, the UHHSG will escalate decisions to the PRC.

# 4.1 Role of the University Collections Advisory Group

The University Collections Advisory Group consists of the heads of collections in the Manchester Museum, the Whitworth Art Gallery, the Head of Special Collections in the Library and the UHHM. The Group exists to:

- Provide advice on the care and management of the University Collections;
- Enable access to specialist advice and services;
- Make recommendations based on the annual report of the University Collections.

Where requested, the Group will provide recommendations to the UHHSG on the University Collections. The Group liaises or convenes when necessary to fulfil its role.

# 4.2 Role of the University History and Heritage Strategy Group (UHHSG)

The University History and Heritage Strategy Group (UHHSG) has overall responsibility for the University Collections. Where necessary and appropriate, the UHHSG will escalate matters to the PRC.

The UHHSG invests the University Historian and Heritage Manager with day-to-day management and authority over the University Collections within the parameters set out in this policy. Over and above the parameters set out in this policy, the UHHM will escalate to the UHHSG any matters where is seems appropriate and necessary to do so. The UHHM will provide an annual report on the University Collections to the UHHSG.

# 5 Care and collection management for the University Collections

The University Collections are diverse and their care requires the co-operation of different parts of the University.

The Cultural Institutions are key partners in the care and conservation of the University Collections and provide specialist advice and services where necessary as requested by the UHHM. Where expertise does not exist within the University, external specialist advice and services will be commissioned by the UHHM.

# 5.1 Acquisitions

Sound reasons must be established before any item is acquired by the University Collections. Only items that meet the criteria below will be acquired.

# 5.1.1 The University Heritage Collection

The UHHM will use sector best practice and obtain specialist advice where necessary to consider and agree acquisitions. To be considered for accession, an object should:

- Reflect the history of the University of Manchester or its predecessor institutions;
- Be a significant example and not a duplicate of an item already owned;
- Be in a display worthy condition and have context that enables the object to be interpreted;
- Not be likely to create a burden of conservation;
- Not pose a threat to the Collections stored or displayed around it;
- Have a unique history and have provenance;
- Not form part of a loan of convenience from another institution or collection (due to a temporary shortage of space or expertise, for example). Loans must remain a separate process. See section 5.8;
- Not have conditions attached by the donor.

If the UHHM deems that an object should be acquired, but falls outside the criteria laid out above, or is valued in excess of £100,000, a recommendation will be made to the UHHSG and the Gift Oversight Group (see section 5.1.4) for consideration.

Periodically, an acquisitions strategy may be adopted to guide acquisitions by the University Collections which will be approved by the University History and Heritage Strategy Group.

University Collections Policy June 2016
# 5.1.2 The University Faculties and Residences Collections

The nominated individual in each unit will be the first point of contact for acquisitions to their respective collection(s). They will consider an object for accession and pursue guidance from the UHHM if the object meets at least one of the following criteria:

- Links to the history, culture and development of the faculty, school, unit or discipline;
- Develops the collection by representing outstanding aspects of the unit or a discipline’s history or be under represented in the collection;
- Offer opportunities for the object to be used in teaching or research;
- Be a significant example. Not a duplicate of an item already owned;
- Be in a display-worthy condition and not be likely to create a burden of conservation;
- Does not pose a threat to the Collection stored or displayed around it;
- Not form part of a loan of convenience from another institution or collection (due to a temporary shortage of space or expertise, for example). Loans must remain a separate process. See section 5.8.

If the nominated individual feels the acquisition meets one of the above criteria they will seek guidance from the UHHM. The UHHM will use sector best practice and obtain specialist advice where necessary to consider and agree acquisitions where:

- The item meets the purpose of the University Collections set out in this policy.
- The item is valued at no more than £100,000.

If the UHHM deems that an object should be acquired, but falls outside the criteria laid out above, or is valued in excess of £100,000, a recommendation will be made to the UHHSG and the Gift Oversight Group (see section 5.1.4) for consideration.

# 5.1.3 All University Collections

The UHHM will exercise due diligence and make every effort not to acquire, whether by purchase, gift, bequest or exchange, any object or specimen unless they are satisfied that the University can acquire a valid title to the item in question. In particular, the University Collections will not acquire any object unless it is satisfied that it has not been acquired in, or exported from, its country of origin (or any intermediate country in which it may have been legally owned) in violation of that country’s laws (for the purposes of this paragraph ‘country of origin’ includes the United Kingdom).

In accordance with the provisions of the UNESCO 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, which the UK ratified with effect from November 1 2002, the University Collections will reject any items that have been illicitly traded. The UHHM will be guided by the national guidance on the responsible acquisition of cultural property issued by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in 2005.

University Collections Policy

June 2016
# University Collections Policy

So far as biological and geological material is concerned, the University Collections will not acquire by any direct or indirect means any specimen that has been collected, sold or otherwise transferred in contravention of any national or international wildlife protection or natural history conservation law or treaty of the United Kingdom or any other country, except with the express consent of an appropriate outside authority.

All acquisitions must be detailed on an object entry form (see appendix 1) and entered into the University Collections Management System.

# 5.1.4 Gifts and Bequests

The UHHSG invests the UHHM with the authority to accept gifts and bequests into the University Collections if they meet the criteria set out in sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2 and 5.1.3.

If the items being donated are estimated to be worth more than £100,000, the UHHM will refer the matter to the Gift Oversight Group for consideration at its next meeting in addition to referring the matter to the UHHSG as laid out in sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2.

If the items being donated are estimated to be worth less than £100,000, but the UHHM feels that there is an element of potential risk either because of what the items themselves are or represent, or because the donor is seen as an entity which could carry reputational risk, the UHHM will escalate the matter to the Director of Alumni and Development who will assess whether the matter should be referred to the Gift Oversight Group.

Should a gift or bequest fail to meet the required standards stated above for suitable acquisition to a Collection, the University is under no obligation to accept an item. The item may be refused in writing, stating the reasons why the gift or bequest cannot be accepted. Unwanted and unsolicited offers should also be returned in the same manner, even if it has been stated that this is not necessary.

Donors must be made aware of the financial and cultural value of the object that they seek to donate. It will be made clear to the donor the terms on which the University is willing to accept the item. The item may not be on permanent public display and the title will be permanently transferred to the University.

The University will not accept gifts with attached conditions. Donations must be unconditional and in perpetuity.

# 5.2 Cataloguing

All items in the University Collections should be included on the University Collections Management System.

All items on the University Collections Management System will be catalogued according to sector best practice. An entry will also be made in the University Collections ledger.

June 2016
# 5.3 Storage, security and insurance

The University Collections are held in multiple locations across the University Estate. Wherever possible, items should be stored according to sector best practice standards.

Items removed from display or in long-term storage must be stored in such a way as to ensure their maximum possible care and protection.

Storage areas should have a suitable and stable environment, which should be monitored.

Handling and movement of objects should be kept to a minimum and only carried out with the permission of the UHHM. Techniques of handling should minimise the risk to the object.

There should be no eating or drinking near collections.

Storage areas should be subject to “good housekeeping”.

All storage areas, cupboards and shelving units should be kept in good repair.

Periodic checks should be made to ensure that collections have not deteriorated and there have been no floods, infestations or mould growth.

Collections are vulnerable during building works to theft and accidental damage. Free access to normally secure areas must not be allowed. If necessary, collections must be moved to temporary, alternative secure storage.

Controls on access to collections by researchers will be implemented as far as is practical, either through staff supervision or by ensuring that when possible only the objects relevant to a researcher are obtained and access is granted in a room away from the main collections store.

Loss, damage or vandalism to an item must be reported immediately to University Security and the UHHM and escalated as appropriate.

The University Collections are covered by the University’s general insurance policy.

# 5.5 Movement

Movement of individual objects or collections for display or research should not be undertaken without good reason due to the possibility of damage to items. Requests to move an item(s) should be made to the UHHM (in the case of the University Heritage Collection) or the respective nominated individual (in the case of the Faculties and Residences Collections). In the case of objects in the Faculties and Residences Collections, the nominated individual should discuss the object movement with the UHHM.

University Collections Policy 8 June 2016
# The UHHM will use sector best practice and obtain specialist advice where necessary to consider and agree movement of objects. If the UHHM deems that an object should be moved, but has the potential for detrimentally affecting the object, negatively influence the University’s decorative condition, or is valued in excess of £100,000, a recommendation will be made to the UHHSG.

Suitable Health and Safety assessments must be made in the event of moving large or heavy objects. Appropriate boxes or container should be used to move objects in, with sufficient protection to keep them safe in transit.

An up to date catalogue or inventory of objects or collections must be made before any movement and checked off again once the relocation is complete and any new damage or change in conditions noted.

# 5.6 Conservation

The University Collection should be cared for in such a manner so as to ensure deterioration is kept to a minimum. The University Collections adhere to the ‘minimum intervention’ principle where the objective is to:

- Measure changes in deterioration.
- Reduce/stabilise the rate of deterioration.
- Provide storage and display spaces that prevent damage or adhere to the level of deterioration expected.

Issues of conservation and preservation will be included in the annual report to the UHHSG.

Nominated individuals for the University Faculties and Residences Collections should bring damage or deterioration to the attention of the UHHM immediately. The nominated individual will liaise with the UHHM regarding enhanced care and conservation.

The UHHM will use sector best practice and obtain specialist advice to consider and agree enhanced care and conservation work. If the UHHM deems that an object requires enhanced care or conservation work and an item’s value is in excess of £100,000 or is of outstanding importance to the University and its history, a recommendation will be made to the UHHSG for consideration.

# 5.7 Display

Many items in the University Collections are on display across the University’s estate. These displays are important for representing the University’s history and building our collective identity and culture.

Items may have been on display for many years and, where possible, effort should be made to protect items, reduce deterioration and provide interpretative information. In doing so, sector best practice will be followed.

University Collections Policy

June 2016

Nominated individuals for the University Faculties and Residences Collections should bring any planned displays to the attention of the UHHM immediately. The nominated individual will liaise with the UHHM regarding the display to ensure sector best practice is followed.

The UHHM will use sector best practice and obtain specialist advice to consider and agree new displays. If the UHHM deems that an object should be displayed but the item’s value is in excess £100,000 or it is of outstanding importance, a recommendation will be made to the UHHSG.

All practical efforts should be made to keep items on display safe and secure. The security of the item will be reviewed periodically by the UHHM and, where necessary, University Security.

# 5.8 Loans

# 5.8.1 Loans out

All requests for loans from the University Collections should be submitted to the UHHM using the loan application form in appendix 3. Nominated individuals for the University Faculties and Residences Collections should bring any requests for loans to the attention of the UHHM immediately.
