Appropriate form of submitted material which embodies their research for examination at the end of the degree. In what follows the term ‘dissertation’ includes other forms of submitted material except where stated.

|4.2|The dissertation is normally examined by one internal and one external examiner.|
|---|---|
|4.3|Although not normally required, the examiners may request the candidate to attend an oral examination prior to formulating their final report and recommendation on the dissertation (see section 8). The terms oral examination and viva voce both refer to the method of examining MSc by Research degrees and are interchangeable. For the purposes of this policy, the term oral examination is used.|
|4.4|Where an oral examination is required please also refer to the oral examination process as described in the Oral Examination Procedure for Postgraduate Research Degrees.|
|4.5|Examiners are not permitted to fail or refer a dissertation on grounds that are not raised with the candidate in an oral examination.|
|4.6|Only one opportunity to resubmit for re-examination is permitted for MSc by Research degrees.|
|4.7|Where applicable, candidates must satisfy the oral requirement of the degree before they can receive the final award.|

# Procedures Prior to MSc Examination - Notice of Submission

|5.1|MSc by Research degree candidates must complete a Notice of Submission Form, available electronically in the University’s progression monitoring system, giving at least six weeks up to a maximum of six months’ notice of their intention to submit their dissertation to enable preparations for the oral examination to be made by the appropriate examiners.|
|---|---|
|5.2|Candidates should seek the advice of their supervisor/s on when to give notice. The supervisor/s opinion is advisory and the decision on when to submit lies with the candidate. The agreement of the supervisor to the submission of a dissertation does not guarantee the award of the degree.|
|5.3|Where the supervisor/s advise a candidate against submitting their dissertation, it is recommended that they note their concerns and reasons for their concerns with the relevant Faculty Doctoral Academy.|
|5.4|On submission of the completed Notice of Submission Form, the candidate’s main supervisor will ensure that examiners are nominated in accordance with the criteria stipulated in the University’s Nomination of Examiners & Independent Chairs for Postgraduate Research Degree Examinations Procedure.|

# Procedures Prior to Msc Examination – Dissertation Submission

9.7 The completed Examiners’ Report Form must be returned to the appropriate Faculty Doctoral Academy within eight weeks (four weeks for the MEnt) of the dissertation first being sent to the examiners.

# Recommendations for the Degree

There are three categories of recommendations for MSc by Research: ‘A’ (award), ‘B’ (refer) and ‘C’ (reject). Within A category, there are two sub-categories. For both A sub-categories, examiners are also required to recommend a grade for the dissertation, as follows.

# CATEGORY A: AWARD

10.1 Award with no corrections - recommendation A(i)

The examiners should select the recommendation A(i) if the dissertation is satisfactory in every way (listed below), there are no corrections to be made to it.

Recommendation A(ii) should be selected if some minor corrections are necessary to the dissertation, as detailed in section 12.1.2.

The examiners may recommend A(i) if they are satisfied that the dissertation is satisfactory in every way and that:

- i. the candidate possesses an appropriate knowledge of the particular field of learning within which the subject of the dissertation falls;
- ii. the results of the research show evidence of the capacity of the candidate to pursue research and scholarship and represent original work;
- iii. the dissertation is presented in a lucid and scholarly manner;

June 2023 Page 4 of 10
# Examination of Master of Science (MSc by Research) Degrees Policy

iv. the dissertation has been submitted in the form prescribed by University regulations and policy;

v. no part of the dissertation has previously been submitted for the award of a degree at this or any other University;

vi. the dissertation and the work reported in it are the candidate’s own.

# 10.2 Award subject to minor corrections - recommendation A(ii)

Recommendation A(ii) should be selected if the examiners are satisfied the dissertation meets the criteria for the degree but some minor corrections are necessary to the dissertation. The corrections, in the view of the examiners, and taking into account the guidance given below, should not be sufficiently serious to merit a recommendation for re-submission and re-examination under Category B.

Minor corrections permissible under A(ii) include:

- i. typographical errors; however, if the errors, although trivial individually, are so numerous as to suggest carelessness on the part of the candidate or so intrusive as to distract the reader’s attention from the argument of the dissertation, the examiners would be fully justified in making a recommendation under Category B rather than A (ii);
- ii. minor amendments and/or replacement of, or additions to, the text or to references or diagrams;
- iii. other more extensive corrections may be made as long as they do not require significant (as defined by the examiners) re-working or re-interpretation of the intellectual content of the dissertation.

If more substantial corrections are required, the examiners should make Category B recommendation.

The required corrections must be provided by examiners on section 4 of the Examiners’ Report Form (MSc by Research for the benefit of the candidate. For recommendation A(ii), the corrections, once carried out by the candidate, must be approved by the internal examiner.

The time permitted for minor corrections (A(ii)) to be completed by the candidate is normally no more than four weeks, from the date the candidate receives the list of corrections from the appropriate School, or Faculty graduate office or Manchester Enterprise Centre. In exceptional circumstances, where there are more than four weeks of work required the candidate may be given 12 weeks to complete the corrections. The examiners’ decision to allow 12 weeks for minor corrections to be completed, must be based on the quantity of the work required and length of time of which it is feasible to complete the corrections.

June 2023 Page 5 of 10
# Examination of Master of Science (MSc by Research) Degrees Policy

The relevant Faculty Doctoral Academy must receive notification, that the minor corrections have been approved by the internal examiner within 2 weeks of the candidate submitting the corrections.

The examiners’ decision to recommend A(ii) should be made on the grounds that the dissertation will NOT require a further examination. The decision whether to recommend an A(ii) as opposed to B should not be determined by the candidate’s personal circumstances and whether they will be able to correct the dissertation within the four-week timeframe.

The candidate is expected to be available in the period after the examination to complete minor corrections as part of their responsibilities in the examination of their degree. In very exceptional circumstances, the candidate may apply to the appropriate Faculty Doctoral Academy for permission to submit the corrected dissertation later than within the four-week timeframe. Candidates and examiners should refer to the appropriate Faculty Doctoral Academy if further guidance on minor corrections is required.

# 10.3 MSc by Research Degree Grades (Distinction, Merit, Pass)

For both recommendations A(i) and A(ii), the examiners are required to indicate whether the dissertation should be awarded the following grade:

i. Distinction;ii. Merit;iii. Pass.

If the dissertation is of sufficient quality, both in presentation and research content, the examiners may recommend the award of Distinction or Merit.

For Distinction (marked at 70% or higher), the candidate is expected to demonstrate, through the dissertation, outstanding knowledge of the research topic, originality, high competence in the application of appropriate research methodology, and ability to critically evaluate the research context and outcome.

For Merit (marked at 60% - 69%), the candidate is expected to demonstrate, through the dissertation, good knowledge of the research topic, competence in the application of appropriate research methodology, and ability to critically evaluate the research context and outcome.

The final degree award will be decided by the appropriate postgraduate degrees panel, taking into consideration of both the examiners' recommendation and the performance of the candidate in June 2023.

# 10.4 CATEGORY B: REFER FOR RE-EXAMINATION

Referral under recommendation B requires the candidate to resubmit the dissertation for re-examination. A candidate will be permitted to resubmit on only one occasion. See the University’s Resubmission and Re-examination of Postgraduate Research Degrees Policy [INSERT LINK] for details of resubmission and re-examination.

Examiners are required to make category B recommendations when the dissertation is unsatisfactory and requires a further examination.

For category B recommendations, examiners must submit a statement detailing the required corrections. Examiners should offer guidance to the candidate when their recommended changes will impact on the word limit of the dissertation; this may include suggestions on which parts of the dissertation can be reduced to allow for any additions.

The candidate is normally required to revise and resubmit the dissertation for the Masters degree within four months of receiving the examiners’ statement detailing the required corrections from the appropriate Faculty Doctoral Academy.

Any PGR who wishes to request an extension to their resubmission deadline, due to mitigating circumstances, should make the request via the normal extension application process within the School.

# 10.5 CATEGORY C: REJECT

Where examiners are not satisfied that the dissertation have met the standards required, and have not found evidence that the dissertation could be corrected under category A or B, they may recommend category C; reject.

For recommendation C, examiners must justify their decision not to recommend the MSc by Research in the Examiners’ Report Form. When the recommendation of the examiners is not to make an award, the internal examiner(s) will normally be invited to the next meeting of the appropriate School or Faculty postgraduate research degrees panel or Manchester Enterprise Centre examiners’ meeting to assist in its consideration of the case and to answer any questions.

# Examination of Master of Science (MSc by Research) Degrees Policy

# 11. Examiner Disagreement over a Recommendation

11.1 If, after their deliberations, examiners remain unable to reach an agreement on a recommendation, the procedure detailed below must be followed:

|i.|Each examiner must complete a separate Examiners’ Report Form (MSc by Research) giving justification for their recommendation. The forms should be submitted to the appropriate Faculty Doctoral Academy.|
|---|---|
|ii.|The internal examiner/s will be invited to the next meeting of the appropriate postgraduate research degrees panel to discuss the reports and to see if a recommendation can be agreed. Before the meeting, the external examiner should be contacted in order to obtain his/her views on the case.|
|iii.|If agreement is not reached, the appropriate postgraduate research degrees panel may, at its discretion, appoint one or more new examiners or may determine other action where appropriate. Additional examiners must not be told the identity of the original examiners nor their specific recommendations.|

11.2 Examiners may consult with staff in the appropriate Faculty Doctoral Academy in the first instance for further advice if necessary. Faculty Doctoral Academy staff may refer any problems or concerns to the Faculty Associate Dean for Graduate Education.

# 12. Approval of Recommendations

12.1 The result recommended by examiners is provisional until approved by the appropriate postgraduate research degrees panel.

12.2 The decision to award a MSc by Research is made on the basis of the examiners’ reports and recommendation, and the candidate's performance in the examinations of the taught component.

12.3 A postgraduate research degrees panel will normally consist of a chair who is a senior academic member of staff, senior academic staff from each School/discipline within that particular School/Faculty and PGR professional service staff.

12.4 An MSc by Research degree recommendation will be approved either at a meeting of the appropriate School or Faculty postgraduate research degrees panel or just by the chair of the panel (i.e. ‘chairs action’).

12.5 If a recommendation is straightforward and there are no issues of concern, a recommendation will normally be approved by chair’s action, and reported to members at the next appropriate postgraduate research degrees panel.

12.6 The recommendation of category C (reject) will normally be considered at the next meeting of the appropriate postgraduate research degrees panel, where members will discuss individual cases and review examiners’ reports. The internal examiner will normally be invited to attend

June 2023 Page 8 of 10
# Examination of Master of Science (MSc by Research) Degrees Policy

At this meeting and in some cases the supervisor(s) may be required to attend. It may also be appropriate to seek further comments, for clarity, from the external examiner.

# Submission of Dissertation and Publication of Result

|13.1|Once the examiners’ report have been received and the recommendation has been approved either by chair’s action or by the appropriate postgraduate research degrees panel, the appropriate Faculty Doctoral Academy is able to release the approved recommendation to the candidate.|
|---|---|
|13.2|In the case of an A(ii) recommendation (award with minor corrections), the appropriate Faculty Doctoral Academy must have received notification from the internal examiner that minor corrections have been satisfactorily completed by the candidate before the final award can be confirmed.|
|13.3|Results will not be formally published until the candidate has submitted an electronic copy of their final dissertation to the online institutional repository.|
|13.4|Any delay in the submission of the final dissertation will delay formal publication of the result (i.e. completion of the candidate’s record on the student record system), which will in turn delay the release of the degree certificate and graduation.|
|13.5|A degree will not be conferred upon any person who has a relevant debt outstanding to the University. Candidates with debt outstanding to the University should contact the Student Services Centre in the first instance to arrange prompt payment.|

# Appeals

|14.1|Appeals may be made only on specific grounds as detailed in the University’s Academic Appeals Procedure.|
|---|---|
|14.2|If the external examiner has concerns relating to standards within the institution they should approach the internal examiner in the first instance. Once all internal procedures have been exhausted including a confidential report to the Vice-President (Teaching, Learning and Students), they have the right to contact the QAA.|
