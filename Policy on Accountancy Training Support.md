# Introduction

The Directorate of Finance (Finance) is committed to developing high potential staff through professional accountancy qualifications. This policy sets out what study support is offered and Finance’s expectations of staff receiving that support.

# Overview of Support

During the summer each year, Finance will advertise financial support opportunities for all finance staff wishing to study AAT and CIMA/ACCA or other professional finance qualifications which may be appropriate to the role.

A selection panel will consider each candidate’s application and award the available funding to the most suitable candidates.

Funding in one year does not guarantee funding the following year.

During the year of funding the studier will receive financial and study leave support in addition to mentoring to enable them to successfully complete their studies.

Completion of a professional qualification does not necessarily lead to promotion within the University.

If a studier fails a course within their qualification, Finance will not continue to provide any financial or study support until that course has been passed.

Support to studiers will be reviewed annually in May/June and continued.
support will depend upon examination performance, the studier meeting the accountancy body’s experience requirements, performance in role and available funding.

- Continued support is dependent upon appropriate professional experience being gained; Finance may break study support at the end of any stage until the studier has achieved a promotion.
# Application Process

Applicants will apply in summer of each financial year for the following year’s funding.Applicants will be short listed and potentially interviewed; then informed of outcomes by the end of July.Feedback to each applicant will be provided.

# Financial Support

Successful applicants will be financially supported by Finance in addition to what the central STDU funding can cover.The financial support applied for will cover professional membership fees, exam fees, and agreed course fees (which normally provide all needed textbooks).Professional membership fees will only be supported for the qualification trainees are studying for. Any subscription to other associations or affiliations will not be supported by the training budget or by the department. Trainee membership fees will only be supported if funding is applied for.Subscriptions will only be reimbursed for the periods that the staff member is employed by the University. The University will not reimburse partial reclaims of a subscription for staff joining mid-year. This applies to subscriptions for both trainees and qualified staff.Additional textbooks, Resit fees, and travel costs are not supported.Normally the University does not support revision or mock exam courses unless they are being attended instead of the knowledge course or the
# method of study (i.e. distance learning) results in the combined price of knowledge, revision and mock set being comparably priced to the knowledge evening / weekend course.

⦁ Applicants will be required to apply for Financial support annually (during summer of each year)

# Study Leave Support

⦁ The table below sets out the number of paid study support days for each course, other qualifications will be treated similarly dependant on level of study.

⦁ It is expected that studiers will whenever possible book weekend, evening or distance learning courses as the paid study leave is not sufficient to cover day courses.

⦁ Preference will be given to those candidates for study which meet the grade requirements outlined in the policy. However, candidates which do not meet the grade requirements will be considered if funds are available. This means we can consider Grade 3s for AAT and Grade 4s for CIMA/ACCA if appropriate.

⦁ Self funded students will receive the same leave entitlement as those funded by finance and staff learning and development.

# Conditions of Training

Applicants successful in the selection process will have signed the declaration within the application form which outlines conditions of training and funding. This includes Finance’s expectations of the studier which are that they:
- Consider their time commitment carefully before starting each a course of study;
- Apply in good time for study leave to allow absences to be planned so as to minimise the impact on normal service/work delivery;
- Plan their studies carefully to achieve a reasonable home/work/study life balance;
- Arrange appropriate meetings with their mentor in order to benefit from this source of support and guidance (minimum once per quarter);
- Keep their line manager and the Accountancy Training Manager informed of progress within a course of study including any results from compulsory practice tests or mock examinations and the final examination itself;
- Attend compulsory sessions as required or notify their line manager and Accountancy Training Manager if sessions are missed unavoidably;
- Repay fees as outlined in Conditions of Funding
Trainees will be released to take part in projects for the Directorate of Finance during their working hours but in addition to their current role (for example, a day a week for a number of weeks or a few days consecutively). These Finance Experience Opportunities are a prerequisite of their professional experience and Line managers are will release staff accordingly. These projects will be both inside and outside their own Faculty predominantly from Finance Experience Opportunities provided by central finance.

Please be aware that where possible we will match trainees to their preferred choice of experience, but where this is not possible trainees will be asked directly by the Training Group to assist other departments where suitable notice has been given.
