If you are reading a printed version of this document, you should check [here] to ensure you have the most up to date version.

# Introduction and Purpose

- The University is committed to developing a more open and responsible research environment. In keeping with that commitment, and in response to increasing mandatory requirements from major research funding bodies that peer-reviewed versions of journal articles and conference proceedings with an International Standard Serial Number (“Relevant Works”) are made freely available on publication, the University has adopted this Policy.
- The University must comply with the requirements of funding bodies as failure to do so may (amongst other things):
- make Relevant Works ineligible for submission to the REF; and/or
- impact on the receipt of funding from funding bodies.
- The purpose of this Policy is to:
- support all University employees (“Employees”) and University students (“Students”) in disseminating their research as widely as possible, in a journal of their choice;
- confirm the University’s position on making Relevant Works open access; and
- ensure that all those to whom this Policy applies (see section 2 below) are aware of their rights and responsibilities in ensuring compliance with requirements on open access.
- Whilst this Policy does not apply to outputs which fall outside the definition of Relevant Works, (e.g., books, chapters, analysis code, research methodology) the University strongly encourages researchers to make any such works as openly available as possible in line with our Position Statement on Open Research.

# This Policy applies to all:

Employees and Students, in particular those who create, develop, or are involved in the creation or development of, Relevant Works; andRelevant Works accepted for publication while the author or co-author is an Employee or Student.
