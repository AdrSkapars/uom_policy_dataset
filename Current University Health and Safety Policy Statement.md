# University Health & Safety Policy Statement

Foreword from the President

Staff and students at this University carry out an extremely wide range of activities, some of which involve risks that are new, or unpredictable, or just different. We cannot provide a risk-free environment. We can, however, strive to ensure that all of us make well-informed decisions, and are responsible and considerate about the risks we encounter during our studies and work.

This policy sets out the key principles which guide health & safety management, and the accompanying organisation and arrangements chapters describe in more detail what is expected of managers, staff and students. Everyone has an important part to play, but clear leadership from senior managers is crucial and underpins all our actions. I recognise this, and accept my overall responsibility willingly. But, the task is not an easy one and we need to work together to achieve good health & safety management practices that are compliant with statute, comprehensive, effective and robust, but are also proportionate and achievable in the context of a research-intensive organisation.

We aspire to excellence in all our endeavors and health and safety management is no exception. Our vision is to keep each other safe and well through high standards of health and safety management, by embedding a culture of continuous improvement through effective leadership and collective responsibility.

Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell President and Vice Chancellor

Purpose of this policy

1. It is the policy of the University of Manchester to pursue high standards of health and safety management that are open, supportive and empowering, and responsive to the academic work environment. Our objective is to comply with our statutory obligations, and work beyond these towards good and best practice in the higher education sector.
2. In order to achieve this, the University recognizes that health and safety is a core management function and best practice entails its full integration into the management of all other activities. The University will endeavor to ensure that adequate resources are provided to support this policy.
3. In this context, efficient and effective management means:
        
        (a) embarking on a process of continuous improvement
        
        (b) showing leadership and commitment to managing health and safety on 
            a day-to-day basis and at a strategic level, and leading by    personal example
        
        (c) acknowledging and (where appropriate) rewarding good practice
        
        (d) using the process of informed risk assessment to design out hazards, and achieve appropriate controls over risks that cannot be eliminated
    
        (e) facilitating the involvement of all employees in decisions affecting their health and safety at work and communicating effectively with them
    
        (f) deploying a wide range of communication techniques and strategies to reach staff, students and key stakeholders and to target information in the most appropriate manner
    
        (g) providing competent personnel through effective training,professional development and support, wherever possible from within existing staff resource, but with recognition that some circumstances may require external specialist advice.

4. Internal monitoring and auditing: The health and safety management system will be subject to internal monitoring and auditing throughout the University, and the outcomes from these processes will inform and improve management practices as part of the commitment to continual improvement. From time to time, the University will also undertake appropriate benchmarking and external auditing exercises.
5. Health & Safety Plan: improvements in the University’s health & safety management arrangements will be identified in a planned strategy, and tracked by the Health, Safety and Well-Being Safety Committee.

6. All staff: must take reasonable care of themselves and all others who may be affected by their acts and omissions and comply with both central and local policies and arrangements for safe working to enable the University of Manchester to discharge its legal duties with regard to health and safety. Some staff have specific responsibilities, and these are detailed in the Organisation to implement the health and safety policy, and the accompanying arrangements chapters.

7. All students: in the interests of health and safety, students must not interfere with or misuse any equipment, object, structure or system of work provided by the University of Manchester.

8. All staff and students, and their representatives: are encouraged to participate in decision-making processes locally and campus-wide, and must:

        (a) report any accident at work which results in personal injury or ill health, however minor, and every dangerous occurrence, including fire, using the approved form;

        (b) report “near miss” incidents which have the potential to cause injury or ill health, using the approved form;

        (c) notify the Head of Occupational Health when suffering from a disease or medical condition which may be caused by, or made worse by, work activities (this information will be treated as confidential);

        (d) not proceed with any activity if they feel it poses a threat to their health and safety, or to that of others;

        (e) report any unsafe or unhealthy working conditions, or suspected faults in buildings, building fabric, or in any equipment, without delay and in accordance with school / directorate arrangements.

        (f) undertake health & safety training and induction as appropriate for their role and work activities;

        (g) familiarise themselves with relevant risk assessments for their work activities;

        (h) assist any visitors who may not be familiar with University procedures, to the best of their abilities.

9. For staff and students working in NHS Trust premises: chapter 20 of the University’s health and safety arrangements describes the general principles governing health and safety management in these shared workplaces.

10. Review and update arrangements: The policy will be reviewed annually by the Health, Safety and Wellbeing Committee, and revised or updated as necessary.

11. Consequences of non-compliance: Health and safety management should provide a very positive contribution to the overall efficient and effective management of the University. Non-compliance with this policy will therefore be viewed as a serious matter, ultimately subject to the University’s statutes on disciplinary procedures for staff and for misconduct of students.

12. The Director of Estates and Facilities will have regard at all times to the possible impact of estate developments and facilities provision on the environment and is also responsible for food hygiene in areas under their control.

# Exclusions from this policy:

13. For the avoidance of doubt, this policy is for the University of Manchester only. It does not cover organizations which are separate legal entities.
