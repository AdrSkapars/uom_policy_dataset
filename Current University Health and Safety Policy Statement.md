# University Health & Safety Policy Statement

Foreword from the President

Staff and students at this University carry out an extremely wide range of activities, some of which involve risks that are new, or unpredictable, or just different. We cannot provide a risk-free environment. We can, however, strive to ensure that all of us make well-informed decisions, and are responsible and considerate about the risks we encounter during our studies and work.

This policy sets out the key principles which guide health & safety management, and the accompanying organisation and arrangements chapters describe in more detail what is expected of managers, staff and students. Everyone has an important part to play, but clear leadership from senior managers is crucial and underpins all our actions. I recognise this, and accept my overall responsibility willingly. But, the task is not an easy one and we need to work together to achieve good health & safety management practices that are compliant with statute, comprehensive, effective and robust, but are also proportionate and achievable in the context of a research-intensive organisation.

We aspire to excellence in all our endeavors and health and safety management is no exception. Our vision is to keep each other safe and well through high standards of health and safety management, by embedding a culture of continuous improvement through effective leadership and collective responsibility.

Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell President and Vice Chancellor

Purpose of this policy

1. It is the policy of the University of Manchester to pursue high standards of health and safety management that are open, supportive and empowering, and responsive to the academic work environment. Our objective is to comply with our statutory obligations, and work beyond these towards good and best practice in the higher education sector.
2. In order to achieve this, the University recognizes that health and safety is a core management function and best practice entails its full integration into the management of all other activities. The University will endeavor to ensure that adequate resources are provided to support this policy.
3. In this context, efficient and effective management means
# Internal monitoring and auditing

The health and safety management system will be subject to internal monitoring and auditing throughout the University, and the outcomes from these processes will inform and improve management practices as part of the commitment to continual improvement. From time to time, the University will also undertake appropriate benchmarking and external auditing exercises.

# Health & Safety Plan

Improvements in the University’s health & safety management arrangements will be identified in a planned strategy, and tracked by the Health, Safety and Well-Being Safety Committee.

# All staff

Must take reasonable care of themselves and all others who may be affected by their acts and omissions and comply with both central and local policies and arrangements for safe working to enable the University of Manchester to discharge its legal duties with regard to health and safety. Some staff have specific responsibilities, and these are detailed in the Organisation to implement the health and safety policy, and the accompanying arrangements chapters.

# For staff and students working in NHS Trust premises

chapter 20 of the University’s health and safety arrangements describes the general principles governing health and safety management in these shared workplaces.

# Review and update arrangements

The policy will be reviewed annually by the Health, Safety and Wellbeing Committee, and revised or updated as necessary.

# Consequences of non-compliance

Health and safety management should provide a very positive contribution to the overall efficient and effective management of the University. Non-compliance with this policy will therefore be viewed as a serious matter, ultimately subject to the University’s statutes on disciplinary procedures for staff and for misconduct of students.

# The Director of Estates and Facilities

will have regard at all times to the possible impact of estate developments and facilities provision on the environment and is also responsible for food hygiene in areas under their control.

# Exclusions from this policy:
