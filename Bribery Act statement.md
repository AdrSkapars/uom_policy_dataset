# Integrity in Business Activities at The University of Manchester - a Statement

The University of Manchester is a higher education institution of international renown, with ambitions to be in the top 25 Universities in the world by 2015. Our staff and students come from across the globe and we pride ourselves on our reputation for acting fairly and ethically wherever we operate. Our reputation is built on our values as a University, the values of our employees, students and alumni and our collective commitment to acting with integrity throughout our organisation. The University of Manchester condemns corruption in all its forms and we will not tolerate it in our business activities or in those we do business with.

The Bribery Act 2010, provides for 4 bribery offences:

Bribing: offering, promising or giving an advantage;Being bribed: requesting, agreeing to or accepting an advantage;Bribing a foreign official;Failing as an organisation to prevent any person who performs services on its behalf from committing an act of bribery.

If convicted of a bribery offence, the University may receive a significant fine and suffer lasting reputational damage. If you are convicted of a bribery offence, you could face up to ten years in prison. The potential harm done by bribery, both to the University and to you, is long term and hugely outweighs any potential short term gain. Bribery is just not worth the risk.

If you have any doubts about anything at all, you can speak to your line manager or the Universityâ€™s Anti-Bribery Officer (the Head of Compliance & Risk) in complete confidence. We are committed to eradicating corruption and we will stand by you in acting ethically.

Remember, take the RIGHT approach, and we can ensure that the University continues to operate with integrity:

- Responsibility. You are responsible for your actions. If you break the law, you will have to face the consequences - which could mean a fine, imprisonment, or both.
- Integrity. Don't compromise your integrity. If you think something is wrong, report it. If you aren't sure, consult. Don't ever let yourself be forced into doing something you know or suspect is wrong.
- Genuineness. Always pay genuine prices for genuine goods and services. Never pay over the odds. Agents who ask for especially large fees or commissions may do so in order to pay bribes on your behalf. If this happens, you will be responsible. Excessive payments are obvious and will always be uncovered.
- Honesty. Act honestly and in good faith at all times and in all aspects of your work.
- Transparency. Keep accurate records (including all invoices and receipts) of everything that you do, especially in relation to the payments you make and what they are for. Full and accurate records demonstrate complete transparency and that you have nothing to hide.
