# Credit Control Policy

Purpose:

The Credit Control Policy supports the University in running an efficient and effective system of credit management. It ensures that all parties involved are aware of the University’s approach to the practice and the procedures involved in the recovery of outstanding debt, both Research and commercial, tuition and non-tuition related. The aim of the Policy is to:

- Minimise the financial and reputational risk to the University and enable the proactive management of all debt incurred by organisations and or students; and
- Promote a strong credit control ethos with in the University that will support collaborative and co-working in Faculties, Schools and other relevant central offices.

# Policy:

# Customers

All new and existing customers, where applicable will have a credit worthiness check.

# Sales Invoicing and Debt

All invoices must be raised in compliance with the University’s general invoicing advice detailed in the Financial Regulations and the Finance Procedures.

www.finance.manchester.ac.uk/compliance/

Any changes to the University’s payment terms of 30 days must be signed off by the Director of Finance before customer creation and / or billing takes place.

All overdue debt will be chased by the Credit Control Office in line with the University dunning cycle which will issue reminder letters on the age of the debt and, where necessary, be referred to a collection agency / or solicitors for collection.

All non-collectable debt over 365 days overdue will be recommended for write off, unless the debt has been referred onto an external third part agency for recovery. All recommendations for write off will be fully communicated to, and agreed with, the Head of Transaction Services, and borne centrally.

Any invoices which have been raised without compliance with the University’s procedures e.g. failure to obtain a purchase order document from the customer, and which remains unpaid after it becomes overdue, should be credited by the Faculties/Areas.

All queries raised by the customer in relation to disputed goods and services must be resolved wherever possible within 5 working days of receiving the query and the Credit Control Team emailed with the resolution.

If Faculties/Areas are in negotiation with Customers in regards to debt they must invite/involve the Credit Control Manager in any discussions. In exceptional circumstances arrangements of repayment of debt may be allowed. This will require the express written approval of the Head of Transactional Services or the Credit Control Manager.

# Accommodation and Other charges

All accommodation charges owing to the University must be paid in Pounds Sterling. All payments must be accompanied by the University ID number and the name of the customer to whom the payment relates.

In the event that an invoice is not paid on the agreed date, a late payment charge of £25.00 will be added and the customer to whom the overdue invoice relates will be advised immediately by post and or by email.

If a customer is unable to meet the published deadlines for the payment of their accommodation or other charges, they must contact the central Credit Control Team immediately and, in any event, before the date on which the payment is due so that their options including, where appropriate, alternative payment arrangements, can be discussed and agreed. All overdue payments will be referred to, and followed up, by the central Credit Control Team.

# Research Debt

Research project invoices should be defined by a signed contract between the University and the research providers.

Research debt will attract a predefined contractual collections period depending on the project and sponsor.

Research debt which remains unpaid because it has been invoiced without due regard to the contractual obligations should be credited back to the original research code.

Where services and or deliverables have not been met in line with the contractual agreement; the invoice should be credited back to the original research code until such time the service/deliverable has been completed.

# Unallocated Credit Notes and Payments

All unallocated credit notes and credit payments over 30 days will be reviewed by the central Credit Control Team with a view to allocating to an invoice or refunding back to the customer.

# Refunds

In order to protect the University from accusations/attempts of money laundering and fraud, we must, wherever possible, refund payments using the same method by which they were received.
