# 1. Introduction and Purpose

- 1.1. The University may choose to name buildings, facilities and other public spaces after individuals of high distinction with close associations with the University.
- 1.2. Philanthropy is a significant driver and motivator for naming and is an increasingly important income stream that allows the University to deliver and enhance its strategic ambitions. Recognising donors, through the naming of buildings, facilities and other public spaces, is a mechanism to recognise their contributions and embed a culture of giving across campus, which will leverage more, and more ambitious, support in the future.
- 1.3. The purpose of this policy:
- 1.4. Ensures that naming recognition decisions for buildings, facilities and public spaces are made in a coherent and consistent way in accordance with the University’s objectives.
- 1.5. Ensures compliance with wider University regulations and procedures.
- 1.6. Establishes the processes and criteria for
- 1.6.1. decision-making for approval of naming recognition;
- 1.6.2. term limits of naming recognition;
- 1.6.3. potential revocation of naming recognition;
- 1.6.4. Ensures that the rationale for naming recognition decisions can be clearly articulated.

# 2. Scope and definitions

- 2.1. This policy will apply where:
- 2.1.1. The University wishes to name a significant element of the University Estate, as defined in 2.2. to honour an individual of distinction.

|2.1.2.|The University has received a high-level philanthropic gift as outlined in 6.3 below, and wishes to recognise the donor.|
|---|---|
|2.1.3.|Future updates and changes to this policy will be approved by the Board of Governors on the recommendation of the Planning and Resources Committee (PRC).|

# 2.2. For the purposes of this policy

The definition of a ‘significant’ part of the Estate includes buildings, wings of buildings, and significant spaces within buildings (such as floors, major lecture theatres, laboratories, etc.), and substantial external public realm spaces (Quads, squares, courtyards, etc.). In cases where there is any doubt as to whether part of the Estate is considered ‘significant’ the Deputy Secretary should be consulted, who will seek confirmation from those others listed under 3.1 as necessary.

# 2.3. This policy will not apply where:

|2.3.1.|Naming is associated with academic posts, academic research, fellowships, or studentships.|
|---|---|
|2.3.2.|Naming is associated with parts of the University Estate valued under £250,000 or gifts under £250,000. Naming at this level will be considered by the Registrar, Secretary and Chief Operating Officer and, where appropriate, the relevant Faculty Dean.|

# Roles and Responsibilities

It is the responsibility of the Finance and Capital Planning Sub-Committee (FCPSC) to receive and consider proposals for the naming of the estate, including any proposals to rename existing buildings.

# 3.2. Roles:

|3.2.1.|FCPSC to approve naming opportunities, excluding buildings, where the naming is associated with gifts of more than £250,000, but less than £1 million and report such decisions to PRC (see also 4.2-4.4 below relating to criteria and process for the Naming Committee). FCPSC does not consider or approve honorific naming.|
|---|---|
|3.2.2.|PRC to consider and approve all naming opportunities, excluding buildings, that are significant parts of the estate (as defined in 2.2 above) or where the naming is associated with gifts of more than £1 million, but less than £10 million. PRC will consider, approve, or reject all honorific naming of internal spaces. PRC will make recommendations to the Board of Governors on the naming of buildings or naming associated with gifts over £10m.|
|3.2.3.|The Board of Governors to approve naming opportunities that are associated with buildings or gifts that exceed £10m, and honorific naming related to buildings and public spaces.|

# General Principles

Process for the naming of any part of the University Estate
# Policy on Naming for University buildings, facilities, and public spaces

4.1. Any potential naming of any significant part of the Estate (as defined under 2.2), will be considered by the FCPSC, as defined in 3.1.4.1.1. All proposals should be submitted to the Deputy Secretary. All submissions will be reviewed by the Deputy Director before forwarding them to the relevant committee.4.1.2. FCPSC will review all proposals and, noting the remit of the Committee set out in 3.2.1 above, either make decisions or submit recommendations to the PRC for consideration.4.1.3. PRC will review all recommendations from the FCPSC and, noting the remit of the Committee set out in 3.2.2. above either make decisions or submit recommendations to the Board of Governors.4.1.4. The Board of Governors will make decisions in accordance with its remit set out in 3.2.3 above.4.2. This process will include due diligence to ensure suitability and will include consultation, as appropriate with GOG, the Director of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion and/or the University and Medical Archivist.4.3. From time to time, for example when gift solicitations proceed at speed, FCPSC, PRC or Board of Governors by circulation reach a decision. In such cases the Chair will ask members to provide comments by a given deadline, following which (s)he will, after due consideration, will confirm the decision by the committee or, if necessary, will convene a meeting as soon as possible for the case to be discussed.

# Wider considerations for all Estates-related naming recognition

4.4. Any naming recognition on the physical campus must comply with any legal agreements entered into by the University, such as wider funding agreements or limitations imposed by the planning authorities.4.5. Building names should enhance the University’s brand, ensuring that names are compatible with the aims, values and goals of the University.4.6. Building names must have clarity and simplicity, aiding orientation and movement around the campus. Compound names should be avoided.4.7. Names used for existing structures such as buildings or facilities, on campus or in surrounding areas, should not be re-used.4.8. Care should be taken when using names for buildings which are also associated with major events, to avoid confusion.4.9. Buildings should not normally be named after specific disciplines.4.10. Any resulting naming recognition signage for capital projects will be in line with the University’s corporate identity, and corporate or organisational logos will only be included when not to the detriment of the University’s brand.

Naming Recognition relating to Individuals of Distinction falls under sections 6.9 to 6.12 of the policy.

Naming Revocation relating to Philanthropy and Individuals of Distinction falls under section 6.13 of the policy.

# 6.1. Process for Identifying Naming Opportunities

|6.1.1.|The Division of Development and Alumni Relations (DDAR), working closely with academic and professional services colleagues, will be responsible for identifying and confirming the circumstances where the University may wish to recognise donors via an appropriate naming. The Director of Development and Alumni Relations has the responsibility for ensuring all naming opportunities relating to philanthropy conform to this Policy and are approved according to the processes outlined below before they are discussed with prospective donors.|
|---|---|
|6.1.2.|Where naming opportunities can be identified at the outset of a project (e.g. for specific capital programmes) these will form part of the fundraising strategy for that project.|
|6.1.3.|Naming opportunities will also be encouraged and considered for existing buildings.|
|6.1.4.|Faculties, Schools and other units across the University are expected to contact the Division of Development and Alumni Relations about potential naming recognition before discussing them with prospective donors, in order to ensure that all naming recognitions adhere to this policy.|

# 6.2. Criteria for Naming recognition connected to philanthropy

|6.2.1.|In determining the appropriateness of considering naming recognition in a particular circumstance, the following factors will be considered:|
|---|---|
|6.2.1.1.|Whether the gift level committed for the specific priority in question meets the gift level guidelines within this Policy, as summarised under 6.3.|
|6.2.1.2.|The appropriateness of associating the donor’s name, or the preferred name suggested by the donor, with the University. Gift discussions reaching this stage of development will already have been considered by GOG in terms of the acceptability of the source of funding, and any reputational risk identified by that group which may be relevant to a naming opportunity will be borne in mind.|

# 6.3. Gift Level Guidelines

The recommendations below suggest an appropriate range of donation levels where the University may wish to recognise the generosity of a donor.

April 2023 Page 4 of 8
# Policy on Naming for University buildings, facilities, and public spaces

|6.3.2.|For capital gifts for buildings and equipment, the value of the donation should normally meet a minimum of 30% of the estimated cost of the building/facility. However, other amounts may be considered appropriate on a case-by-case basis (minimum of £250,000). A more flexible approach may be appropriate for the naming of existing buildings and facilities, but the estimated current value of that building will provide an appropriate starting point for the above percentage guidelines. Term limits should also be considered in each case to give clarity to all parties.|
|---|---|
|6.3.3.|Naming proposed for Public spaces such as courtyards or parks, will normally require the gift to cover the full cost of the feature and a maintenance fund at a level agreed upon with Estates.|

# Naming Recognition for wider philanthropic contributions across campus

6.4.1.
It may be appropriate to name a facet of the University in recognition of contributions made by donors to the University, where no gift has been made towards the cost of the specific project in question. In these cases, the net present value of any gifts to the University from the donor may be considered. Such cases should follow the consultation process outlined in 4.1 before seeking approval from PRC and the Board of Governors as appropriate in accordance with the respective remits of those bodies.

# Term limits for recognition relating to Philanthropy

|6.5.1.|Consideration will always be given to the term for which naming of any facility or activity should be conferred, following the guidelines below:|
|---|---|
|6.5.2.|For new buildings and facilities or parts thereof, it will be customary to confer naming for the useful life of the building.|
|6.5.3.|Where a building or facility is leased, it may be appropriate to name the building or facility for the term of the lease.|
|6.5.4.|If appropriate and possible, after a term limit has expired the donor will be given the opportunity to renew their gift for the prolongation of the naming for another agreed period. Equally, the University may consider that the strength of brand and reputational benefit of the existing naming justifies a continuation of the naming with no further gift support.|

# Changed campus circumstances or priorities relating to an existing naming

6.6.1.
In circumstances where the purpose of the building, facility, or other activity in question change considerably during the agreed period of naming recognition (through the need for redevelopment, for example), reasonable effort will be made to notify the donor or their representatives and to discuss whether there might be any impact on the intended use of their gift. Every effort will be made to honour the intention of the original gift and to identify alternative appropriate naming recognition opportunities, to address the circumstances in mutually agreeable ways.

# Process of Approval of Naming recognition relating to Philanthropy

6.7.1.
Any approvals for naming related to philanthropic gifts will follow the approval processes as outlined in section 4 above.

# 6.8. Confirming the offer of naming recognition with donors

|6.8.1.|Once internal approval has been fully confirmed in line with this Policy, subsequent contact with donors to offer naming recognition may be made by either the academic unit or the Division of Development and Alumni Relations, or a Senior Officer of the University, following consultation with the Division of Development and Alumni Relations.|
|---|---|
|6.8.2.|The Division of Development and Alumni Relations is responsible for facilitating and managing the written agreements for naming recognition, which will incorporate the relevant aspects of this Policy.|

# 6.9. Naming Recognition relating to Individuals of Distinction

6.9.1.
This part of the policy is concerned with the naming of significant parts of the University Estate (as defined under 2.2) after individuals of distinction, where there is no link to philanthropy.

# 6.10. Criteria for Naming significant parts of the Estate after individuals of distinction

|6.10.1.|Naming of significant parts of the Estate (as defined under 2.2) will be reserved for those who have had a transformational impact on the University or the wider world. The University has many other ways of recognising outstanding contributions through its programme of Awards and Honours. Exceptional circumstances where naming of a significant element of the campus estate might be considered would normally combine:|
|---|---|
|6.10.2.|A wish to honour Individuals with close associations to the University who have made outstanding and sustained contributions to UK, European, or wider international societies and/or global higher education and research, and at the very highest levels.|
|6.10.3.|Circumstances where the naming of a part of the Estate would be especially relevant, when compared with the University’s many other forms of top-level recognition.|
|6.10.4.|Consideration will also be given to any opportunity cost which may be relevant, should the same element of the Estate have strong potential for attracting high level philanthropic support.|

# 6.11. Process of Approval of Naming and term limits for individuals of distinction

|6.11.1.|Any approvals for naming related to individuals of distinction will follow the approval processes as outlined in section 4 above.|
|---|---|
|6.11.2.|Naming recognition connected to significant parts of the Estate to honour individuals of distinction, where approved, it will be customary to confer naming will normally be granted for the useful life of the building or space.|

# 6.12. Confirming the offer of naming recognition for individuals of distinction

6.12.1.
Once internal approval has been fully confirmed in line with this Policy, subsequent contact with individuals (or their family, representatives or descendants), may be made by either the proposal sponsor or the Registrar, Secretary and Chief Operating Officer of the University.

6.12.2.
Where appropriate, the Directorate of Legal Affairs and Board Secretariat will be responsible for facilitating and managing written agreements for naming of significant parts of the Estate after individuals of distinction, in line with the wider terms of this Policy.

# 6.13. Revoking of naming

|6.13.1.1.|The donor, the individual of distinction (or their family, representatives, or descendants) and the University reserve the right to revoke naming, particularly in the unlikely development of reputational risk. Where naming is related to philanthropy:|
|---|---|
|6.13.1.1.1.|The University has no financial obligation to return any received contributions to the donor. The exact terms of revocation will be outlined in the relevant gift agreement.|
|6.13.1.1.2.|If the donor is unable to fulfil agreed gift instalments on a multi-year pledge upon which the naming was bestowed, the University reserves the right to withdraw the specific agreed naming, while seeking to negotiate an alternative and appropriate recognition opportunity with the donor, if necessary.|
|6.13.1.2.|Any revoking of naming will be initially considered by the naming committee. As appropriate, FCPSC will consult and seek approval from PRC and/or the Board of Governors.|
