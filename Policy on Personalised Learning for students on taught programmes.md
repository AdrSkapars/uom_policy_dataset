# The University of Manchester Policy on Personalised Learning for Students on Taught Programmes

# Introduction

1. The University of Manchester is well-placed to deliver personalised learning across the student experience but needs to strike a balance between curriculum choice and excellent small group teaching. Excellent advising from academic staff, expert support staff and peers should be a normal and expected part of the student experience.

2. The University’s ethos for personalised learning is to promote a culture in which respect for learners is paramount and where students are actively encouraged to develop constructive academic relationships with individual teachers, together with a sense of identity within a cohort of learners.

# Policy on Personalised Learning for Students on Taught Programmes

Students will be given ample opportunities to develop, articulate and defend their own arguments and opinions.

Students will be encouraged to take ownership of their learning experience and to develop the constellation of skills associated with a Manchester Graduate as defined in the Purposes of a Manchester Undergraduate Education. The combined effect is intended to stimulate a learning culture that enables students to achieve their full potential and whose graduates will be highly competitive in the knowledge economy.
