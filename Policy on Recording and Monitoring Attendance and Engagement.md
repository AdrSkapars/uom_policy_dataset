# The University of Manchester Policy on Recording and Monitoring Student Attendance and Engagement

# 1. Introduction

1.1 The University is committed to supporting students to successfully complete their programmes of study and to achieve the best possible results. In order for this to happen, it is vital that students’ engagement with all parts of their programme is encouraged, supported and monitored and that any issues with attendance or engagement can be quickly identified and relevant support put in place.

1.2 The University is dedicated to providing a positive student experience and, as part of this, is committed to ensuring that appropriate and timely processes are in place when there are concerns about a student’s attendance or engagement. Provision of relevant support, referral or advice will be put in place wherever possible to aid students’ continued attendance and engagement with their studies, in cases where concerns have been flagged.

# 2. Purpose and Scope

2.1 This policy aims to provide clarity in relation to the University’s expectations of recording and monitoring student attendance and engagement, to ensure that the University proactively monitors student wellbeing, supports academic performance and meets any relevant external body requirements with regards to Undergraduate, Taught Postgraduate and Postgraduate Research students.

2.2 It should be read in conjunction with Regulation XX: Monitoring Attendance and Wellbeing of Students. In relation to section 2 of Regulation XX, each School will determine the attendance and engagement requirements for Student Visa Holders in accordance with section 4 of this policy.

# 3. The Policy

# Recording Attendance and Engagement

3.1 Students are expected to attend all scheduled teaching and learning sessions in every year of study, unless alternative arrangements or flexibility in attendance has been agreed for individual students, if unavoidable circumstances such as illness prevents them from attending or if absence has been authorised. This includes both on-campus teaching as well as online/blended, distance or remote learning modes of delivery.

3.2 Schools should determine points of contact within a programme of study, along with other indicators that will enable them to monitor a student’s attendance or engagement with their programme (see further details in the Guidelines for monitoring student attendance and engagement).

3.3 School procedures for recording and monitoring attendance and the procedures for following up absences must be published in Programme Handbooks and/or online. This information must also include the consequences of non-attendance or engagement and details of sources of advice and support for students who may be struggling. The University has an obligation to report non-attendance or engagement.
# Monitoring Attendance and Engagement

Where a School records a pattern of non-attendance or engagement that meets the trigger points or raises concern about an individual student, the School must contact the student and request that they attend a meeting with their Programme Director (or nominee), or PGR Director (as relevant).

If the student fails to respond to this request to meet, within 5 working days, and/or is absent on one further occasion, or attends the meeting but fails to provide a satisfactory explanation for not complying with the expected attendance and engagement requirements, the School must issue a formal warning.

The warning must indicate the steps to be taken to affect the necessary improvement in attendance, including the consequences of further poor attendance. This letter will be kept on the student’s file or in the eProg personal document store for Postgraduate Research students.
# 3. Student Attendance and Engagement

3.11 If the student fails to comply with the steps to be taken to improve attendance as outlined above, the Examination Board/PGR progress committee may refuse the student permission to proceed on their programme, with the consequences that s/he may be excluded from the programme of study. Examination Boards can also refuse referred assessment if there are concerns about students’ attendance or engagement.

3.12 A student who is refused permission to take any form of assessment or progress on the grounds of unsatisfactory attendance or engagement may submit an appeal against that decision within ten working days of the notification of the decision, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation XIX (Academic Appeals). In order to allow sufficient time for the completion of an appeal, the latest date upon which a refusal may be issued for taught students is the last teaching day of the second semester.

3.13 In cases where the School is satisfied that circumstances exist which show good cause for the student’s failure to comply with the attendance or engagement requirements, alternative action may be taken. This should include referral to relevant support services where appropriate.

Concerns for Students’ Wellbeing

3.14 If a student’s lack of attendance or engagement raises concerns about their wellbeing, Schools should try to contact the student as soon as possible and arrange a meeting, either face-to-face, on the phone or online.

3.15 If the contact attempts are unsuccessful, Schools should have a process in place to try to locate the student/flag up concerns with relevant parties.

# 4. Recording and monitoring attendance for Student/Tier 4 Visa Holders on taught programmes

4.1 As the holder of a licence to sponsor international students for a Student Route (formerly known as Tier 4) visa, the University of Manchester must comply with a range of legal requirements that include the recording and monitoring of the physical attendance of Student/Tier 4 visa holders.

4.2 The University will ensure that it has systems, processes, and procedures to record the physical attendance of students on its programmes and has in place timely and effective methods of escalation where a student fails to engage. Contact points for recording physical attendance must include:

- Two physical academic contact points a week with the student during teaching weeks, unless absence has been authorised by the School (e.g. for illness or wellbeing issues).
- A monthly contact point during the summer period where a student is required to complete academic work.
- A formal contact point with the student every 60 days where they are undertaking a resit and not required to participate in their programme of study.

4.3 If a student does not meet the physical attendance requirements set out in 4.2, the School must proceed with the escalation process set out in the Attendance and Engagement Monitoring Procedure for Student Visa Holders. The primary functions of
# 4.4 Continued failure to meet the physical attendance requirements will result in a warning to the student that the University will be required to withdraw the student from the programme and withdraw sponsorship if the Student, without exceptional reason, does not engage appropriately within a 30 working day period.

# 4.5 If the student fails to engage appropriately within 30 working days of a warning, and there is no exceptional reason for non-engagement, the student will be notified that a decision has been made to withdraw them from the programme and to withdraw visa sponsorship, and the reasons for that decision.

# 4.6 A student will have five working days to submit an appeal against the decision, which will be reviewed by the Head of Student Admissions and Administration, in the Division of Student and Academic Services. If the student does not appeal the decision, or the student appeals but the Head of Student Admissions and Administration determines that there are no exceptional reasons why the decision should be overturned, the University will withdraw the student from the programme and withdraw sponsorship in accordance with section 8 (Termination of this Agreement) of the Student Terms and Conditions.

# 4.7 This process should be read in conjunction with section 3, to ensure that attendance or engagement patterns which might raise concerns regarding an individual student, such as wellbeing concerns, are appropriately identified and escalated to relevant support services.
