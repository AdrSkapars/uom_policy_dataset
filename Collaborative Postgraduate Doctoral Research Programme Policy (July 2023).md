# 1. Introduction

1.1 This document sets out the policy for collaborative postgraduate research arrangements:

- Split-site doctoral research programmes;
- Individual split-site agreements;
- Joint doctoral research programmes;
- Dual doctoral research programmes.

1.2 This policy should be read alongside the relevant associated procedural document:

- Management of Split-Site Doctoral Research Programmes Procedure
- Management of Joint Doctoral Research Programmes Procedure
- Management of Dual Doctoral Research Programmes Procedure

1.3 This policy forms part of the code of practice for postgraduate research degrees and should be read in conjunction with all relevant regulations, policies and procedures and the Guidance and Procedures for the Quality Assurance of Taught Collaborative Provision.

# 2. Scope and definitions

2.1 This policy is applicable to University of Manchester staff, external collaborators and all full-time / part-time PGRs registered at the University of Manchester on a collaborative postgraduate research programmes (as detailed in section 1).

2.2 An institutional split-site doctoral research programme is defined as a formal collaborative arrangement between the University of Manchester and a partner organisation that leads to a single University of Manchester award but involves cohorts of registered UoM PGRs spending a period of their research away from the University, normally overseas.

2.3 Individual split-site arrangements are defined as those which permit an individual PGR to undertake a period of their research at an approved partner organisation on a one-off basis.

2.4 A joint doctoral research programme is defined as a collaborative arrangement under which two or more awarding institutions together design and deliver a programme leading to a single award made by one institution that references both or all participants.

# Collaborative Postgraduate Doctoral Research Programme Policy

2.5 A dual doctoral research programme is defined as a collaborative arrangement that leads to separate awards from two equal partner institutions. Each partner is responsible for making its own award which references the collaboration with the partner institution, but the two components form a single research experience with a single thesis submission and the programme is managed cooperatively between the two institutions.

# Purpose

3.1 This policy, and the related procedures, provide a framework to ensure that University of Manchester PGRs registered on a collaborative postgraduate research programme have a positive experience comparable with other PGRs and seeks to protect the reputation and standing of the University of Manchester by setting clear expectations and responsibilities for all parties involved in the collaboration.

# Roles and Responsibilities

4.1 It is the responsibility of relevant University of Manchester staff, external collaborators and PGRs registered on a collaborative doctoral programme to adhere to this policy and the associated procedures.

# Rationale

5.1 The University of Manchester set ambitious targets in the area of research degrees, research, collaboration and international links and all proposed new collaborative arrangements should, at an early stage in the process, be considered against the UoM Strategic Vision and Research Strategy objectives to ensure that they have a strong rationale.

5.2 Collaborative doctoral research programmes can help the University meet its research goals by:

- developing and/or extending successful, long-term research collaborations;
- increasing the recruitment of high quality international PGRs;
- promoting world-class collaboration with leading universities, research institutions and/or commercial and industrial organisations.

5.3 Collaborative doctoral research programmes enhance the PGR experience and support employability by enabling PGRs to access facilities, supervision and the research environment at internationally renowned institutions.

# Key Principles for the Establishment of Collaborative Postgraduate Research Arrangements

6.1 The University will only consider entering into an arrangement with world leading institutions and the proposed programme of research must be one which will be enhanced by the collaboration and the high quality research environments.

6.2 The partnership must support one or more of the University’s strategic goals.

6.2 Before entering into a collaborative research agreement with partner institution UoM must be satisfied with:

• the overall academic / research standing and reputation of the prospective collaborative partner;• the robustness of its overall quality control and assurance procedures at the institutional level;• the soundness of its quality management at all levels;• the adequacy of its overall administrative support for quality assurance at the institutional level;• the adequacy of its overall provision for academic and pastoral support and guidance and supervision arrangements for PGRs;• the adequacy of the overall learning support and infrastructure in relation to the ability to meet requirements for awards;• the adequacy of overall staffing in relation to the ability to meet requirements for awards;• the institutions’ experience of delivering comparable programmes at a similar level, or the capability to do so;• that, where appropriate, it has an acceptable record of partnership with other institutions;• that the prospective partner institution is financially stable;• that the UoM can legally enter into a contract with the prospective partner institution;• the prospective partner institution has an understanding of the current practices of UK HE, e.g. in connection with external examining, assessment arrangements, and quality assurance arrangements;• that the institution has the capacity to address differences in cultures and expectations between HE systems in such a way as to ensure that the requirements of the arrangement can be met;• that, if instruction and assessment is to be in a language other than English, it has the capacity to provide translation facilities to an appropriate standard. For research degrees, the PhD thesis has to be submitted in English;• that any institutional differences in policy, procedure, governance and regulation can be agreed and managed;• that institutions ensure the compatibility of admissions policies and processes and agree the required entry requirements;• the training / teaching practice and expectations, including the language of delivery / supervision.

6.3 The University recognises the Salzburg II principles and all proposed collaborative links should be considered against the relevant sections of the document.

# Approval Process (Institutional Split-site, Joint and Dual Award Programmes)

7.1 All new collaborative doctoral research programmes are subject to multi-level approval (school, faculty and institution).

7.3 The Head of School/s proposing any collaborative research programme at School/Faculty level must first discuss the proposal with the Faculty Associate Dean/s for PGR and any other appropriate senior colleagues within the faculty.

7.4 Faculties may devise their own Faculty-level approval process for collaborative research programmes and schools should refer to this when proposing new programmes at Faculty level.

7.5 If the Associate Dean/s support the principles of the proposed collaborative doctoral research programme, then a full proposal should be submitted to the Manchester Doctoral College Strategy Group (MDCSG) and, if applicable, the Transnational Education Group (TNE) for consultation.

7.6 The full proposal should address the key principles for collaborative doctoral research programmes detailed in section 6 of this policy and the key principles for the management of collaborative arrangements listed under section 5 of the relevant postgraduate research degree management procedure (see 1.2).

7.7 All proposal applications should be made by the completion and submission of the relevant new PGR degree approval form.

7.8 If approved by MDCSG and Senate the programme will require a formal and legally binding contract between the University and the partner organisation and the contracts team should be notified of the potential collaboration at the earliest possible stage.

7.9 A study plan will also be required for each individual PGR registered to the programme.

# Approval Process (Individual Split-site Agreements)

8.1 Individual split-site arrangements require Faculty approval via the Faculty Research Degrees Committee or equivalent and detailed processes will be included in Faculty guidelines.

8.2 If approved the arrangement will require a formal and legally binding contract between the University and the partner organisation and the Research Office contracts team should be notified of the potential collaboration at the earliest possible stage.

8.3 A study plan is required for each individual split-site arrangement and should be included with the approval documentation.

# Annual Monitoring

9.1 All research degree provision at the University of Manchester is subject to ongoing annual monitoring and review processes. Collaborative postgraduate research programmes must be included in this exercise and faculties should include specific consideration of issues and evidence relating to collaborative programmes within their annual monitoring processes.

9.2 A key focus of the on-going monitoring processes for collaborative doctoral research programmes must be to ensure that the PGR’s environment whilst they are away from the University is appropriate. The University will need to make an assessment of the appropriateness of the research environment on a

1 The detail of contracts will be determined on a case by case basis and staff from the contracts team will liaise with School/Faculties as appropriate.
