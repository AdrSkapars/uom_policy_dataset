Enquiries to milena.cimmarrusti@manchester.ac.uk

Policies regarding advertising and sponsorship on University web pages are formulated by the Digital Marketing Leadership Team in conjunction with the Division of Communications and Marketing. All University web pages within the domain ‘manchester.ac.uk’ or within the range of internet or intranet protocol addresses assigned to The University of Manchester must comply with the terms of this policy.

# 1. Commercial advertising

Commercial advertising, referring to a situation where the University receives payment or in-kind reimbursement in exchange for an advert, link or brand placement on a University web-page is not permitted anywhere on the www.manchester.ac.uk domain.

# 2. Commercial sponsorship

Commercial sponsorship, where a logo is placed on a University web page to acknowledge sponsorship of a University strategic-related activity is permitted but must adhere to the following rules:

# 2.1

The logo of an organisation sponsoring a University activity must be applied in context, should be relevant and advantageous to the subject matter of the web page and must be seen to further the goals of the University.

# 2.2

No organisations, services or products sponsoring an activity and whose logo appears on University web pages should be in direct competition with any service or product offered by the University or any University affiliated company. The University should also not accept sponsorship from a company who is in direct competition with a supplier appearing on the University’s preferred suppliers list.

# 2.3

Sponsorship must not conflict with the University’s strategic goals, policies or procedures.

# 2.4

The values or opinions of an organisation sponsoring a University activity and whose logo appears on a University web page must not be seen to directly contradict those of the University.
# Non-commercial funders and partners

There are likely to be many situations where the University is engaged with funding partners or linked with organisations for a specific activity or initiative not directly related to commercial sponsorship. Endorsement/recognition of these relationships by featuring the logo of these organisations on the University’s website is permitted but must adhere to the following rules:

# 3.1

It is permitted for the organisation’s logo to link to its homepage.

# 3.2

The partner logo should appear directly below the University’s main logo at as similar a size as possible. If the University does not own the publication, the University logo should sit alongside the partner’s logo, ideally to the left. Exceptions can only be approved by the Division of Communications and Marketing.

# Links to commercial vendors

Links to commercial vendors where there is no sponsorship or payment to the University may be made in the following situations:

# 4.1

Licensed software required for web viewing e.g. Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Flash Player etc.
