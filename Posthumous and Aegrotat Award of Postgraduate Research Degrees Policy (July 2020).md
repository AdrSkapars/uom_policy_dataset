# Introduction

1.1. This policy forms part of the University of Manchester’s Postgraduate Research (PGR) Code of Practice
and should be referred to alongside the ordinances, regulations and policies relating to the examination of
PGR degrees.

1. 2. This policy is applicable to the following full-time and part-time postgraduate research degree programmes
at the University of Manchester:

- Master’s level research degrees: Master of Science (MSc) by Research; Master of Enterprise (MEnt); Master of Philosophy (MPhil).
- Doctoral degrees: Doctor of Philosophy (PhD); Doctor of Medicine (MD).
- Doctor of Business Administration (DBA); Doctor of Clinical Psychology (ClinPsyD); Doctor in Education (EdD); Doctor in Educational and Child Psychology (DEdChPsychol); Doctor of Forensic Psychology (DForensPsy); Doctor of Engineering (EngD); Doctor of Enterprise (EntD); Doctor of Counselling Psychology (DCounsPsych); Doctor of Clinical Science (DClinSci); Doctor of Professional Management (DProfPM or DProfREAM); Doctorate in Professional Practice (DProf).

1.3. This policy relates to the award of a PGR degree in the event of the death of the candidate (posthumous)
or the diagnosis of a terminal / debilitating illness prior to the completion of their programme (aegrotat).

# Posthumous and Aegrotat Award Eligibility

2.1. PGR examiners may recommend that a posthumous award should be made following the death of a
candidate. Posthumous awards should have the support of the deceased candidate’s family prior to any
examination.

2.2. PGR examiners may recommend the award of an aegrotat research degree if it is considered that a
candidate’s diagnosis of a terminal/debilitating illness would preclude them from making the final
submission of the thesis, undertaking the viva, modifications to the thesis or a resubmission of the thesis.

# Posthumous and Aegrotat Award of Postgraduate Research Degrees Policy – July 2020

The candidate, or candidate’s family, are required to confirm that they will accept an aegrotat award prior to any examination.

# 2. Posthumous and Aegrotat Award Policy

|2.3.|The aegrotat award will be considered as the conclusion of a student’s registration on the programme, and there will be no further re-assessment. Where the student is currently on a programme of study which includes a professional component, an alternative exit award may be offered; the aegrotat award will not include the professional award.|
|---|---|
|2.4.|Both posthumous and aegrotat research degrees may be awarded at any stage of the programme or examination process at the discretion of the research degree panel.|
|2.5.|In the case of both aegrotat and posthumous awards, the candidate should normally have completed over 50% of their programme, and have completed a significant enough body of work to demonstrate that they would have met the appropriate standard for the award.|

# 3. Awards after Examination / Submission

|3.1.|Where a thesis has already been examined and a viva has already taken place (prior to death / diagnosis) the examination procedure should continue, as closely as possible, in accordance with the relevant examination policy.|
|---|---|
|3.2.|If the thesis has been submitted but not yet examined, examiners must be nominated in line with policy. The examination will proceed as normal with the exception that any oral examination, corrections or revisions will not be required.|
|3.3.|The examiners may make one of the following recommendations: - Relevant posthumous or aegrotat award
- Relevant posthumous or aegrotat exit/lesser award
- No award
|
|3.4.|The appropriate School or Faculty postgraduate research degrees panel will consider the examiners’ recommendations and joint report and they will determine whether an award be made.|
|3.5.|The decision of the postgraduate research degrees panel not to make an award does not constitute grounds for an academic appeal.|

In exceptional circumstances, examiners may submit separate reports with the permission of the appropriate School or Faculty Graduate Office. Examiners who are unable to agree on a recommendation must submit separate reports.

thesis; any other supporting information e.g. progress reports). The supervisor/s must be satisfied that
there is enough to permit an academic judgement to be made.4.2. For a posthumous award the main supervisor is responsible for presenting the candidate’s work for
consideration to the appropriate School or Faculty postgraduate research degrees panel. The main
supervisor should not add to or enhance the work. The main supervisor will be required to confirm that the

behalf. The main supervisor should not add to or enhance the work. The main supervisor will be required
to confirm that the work is the candidate’s own.4.4. The main supervisor must put forward a written statement of support for the posthumous or aegrotat award,
giving reasons why they feel that the degree should be awarded.4.5. The compilation of the candidate’s work and the supervisor report will be considered by the appropriate
School or Faculty postgraduate research degrees panel, and if the panel is satisfied that there is a case
for an award to be made, examiners will be nominated to assess the work.4.7. If the decision is to proceed to examination, internal and external examiners will be appointed in line with
the Nomination of Examiners & Independent Chairs for Postgraduate Research Degree Examinations
Policy. The examiners must be made aware of the circumstances surrounding the submission.4.8. The examiners should consider the supervisor report, the merits of the work as presented and the
candidate’s potential to complete should they have been able to continue. In place of the viva the
examiners will be permitted to request additional information and/or ask questions of the supervisory team,
prior to making an award recommendation via a joint examiner report.
