The University of Manchester Library is the custodian of outstanding Special Collections of rare books, manuscripts, archives, and visual materials. Comprising over one million items, these collections span six millennia and a vast range of cultures and beliefs. They include almost every format ever used for human communication. We are passionate about promoting these collections, sharing them with diverse audiences, and safeguarding them for future generations to study and enjoy. We therefore welcome applications from other institutions wishing to borrow items from our collections for use in exhibitions.

Any institution wishing to borrow objects from our collections should submit a formal request at least six months in advance of the planned opening date of the exhibition.

As part of the assessment process we will take into consideration the following:

- The condition of the object requested
- Any planned use of the object within the Library and elsewhere
- The exhibition history of the object
- The suitability of the security and environment of the venue’s storage and exhibition spaces
- The duration of the exhibition
- Interpretation of the object and the nature of the exhibition
