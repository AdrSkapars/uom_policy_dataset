# FSE Desk Allocations (Academics, PDRAs & PGRs)

This document outlines the operational principles, process and guidance around desk allocations for Academics, PDRAs and PGRs.

# 1. Operational Principles

1.1. Workspace management covers the Faculty Estate, including Engineering Building A.1.2. All desk allocations are made by the School Operations team.1.3. The current workspace desk allocations are allocated to School, Department or Research Group/Division. This process will be refreshed each academic year and reviewed annually. In areas where Groups share a space (e.g., the thematic spaces) it is expected that discussions around the size and shape of the space will be held jointly.1.4. If space needs to be considered for strategic recruitment, a range of options will be presented to the MECD Management Group (for Engineering Building A) or to School Leadership Team (for other Faculty buildings) for initial discussion.1.5. Visuals for the space will replicate the system currently used by the Department of Computer Science, requiring resource to build functionality to support all areas of the Faculty.1.6. The Master Space Log for each School/Department will be hosted in the UOM-FSE-PS-Operations Teams area and maintained by the School Operations teams.1.7. Deputy School Operations Managers (DSOMs) and Heads of Department (HoDs) will work with Research Group Leads/Division Leads to manage the allocation of space for Academics, PDRAs, and PGRs.1.8. In circumstances where an area is at full capacity and a desk cannot be allocated within a particular research group/division, a temporary alternative within the department will be sought by the DSOM. This may involve moving existing staff to accommodate new starters. Where no alternative can be found within a department, a desk will be sought in a space occupied by another department with approval from the HoD.1.9. Instances where an agreeable solution cannot be found should be escalated to the Head of School.
# Eligibility

|2.1|Academic members of staff at 0.5 FTE or greater will be allocated a desk in an academic office within Engineering Building A. Academic staff at less than 0.5 FTE will be invited to use drop-down space or agree a desk-sharing arrangement with another colleague and Research Group Leads/Division Leads should be made aware of such arrangements.|
|---|---|
|2.2|Visiting, Emeritus and Honorary academic staff will not be allocated a desk in an academic office nor in an open-plan desk area. They will be invited to use drop-down space or agree a desk-sharing arrangement with another colleague and Research Group Leads/Division Leads should be made aware of such arrangements.|
|2.3|PDRAs at 0.5 FTE or greater will be allocated a desk in an open-plan area (Eng A) or shared office/space (non Eng A). PDRAs at less than 0.5 FTE will be invited to share a desk within their research group. It is the responsibility of the Research Group Lead/Division Lead to manage this with support from the School Operations team.|
|2.4|PGR students studying full-time will be allocated a desk in an open-plan area (Eng A) or shared office/space (non Eng A) for the duration of their registered period (excluding Sub. P). PGR students studying part-time will be invited to desk-share within their research group. It is the responsibility of the Research Group Lead/Division Lead to manage this with support from the School Operations team.|
|2.5|PGR students that have entered the submission pending period must vacate their desk unless there are special circumstances necessitating continued use of the desk until their thesis submission and approval from their Research Group Lead/Division Lead. Examples include: use of a specialist workstation or software that cannot be accessed remotely; DASS/Occupational Health recommendation.|
|2.6|Visiting PhD students that pay fees will be allocated a desk in an open-plan area (Eng A) or shared office/space (non Eng A) for the duration of their visit. Non-fee-paying visiting PhD students or those in receipt of a fee-waiver are not eligible for a desk and should use drop-down space or agree a desk-sharing arrangement within their research group.|
|2.7|Doctoral Prize Fellows (e.g. EPSRC) will be allocated a desk despite having visitor status.|
# Process for PGRs

|3.1|The Doctoral Academy will provide the local operations teams with admissions data prior to the four main entry points (September, January, April and July).|
|---|---|
|3.2|Operations teams will use this data to allocate desks prior to their arrival in line with principles outlined above. Email confirmation sent to the Main Supervisor including instruction to relay desk allocation to student upon arrival.|
|3.3|Where additional desks are required (transfer from another institution, delayed programme start etc.) the Main Supervisor must complete the relevant online desk request form. The local operations team will then allocate a desk and send confirmation by email.|
|3.4|Local operations teams email Main Supervisor approximately one month in advance of the student’s programme end date to prompt and advise on vacating the desk.|
|3.5|Line Managers/Supervisors should email their local operations team to inform them of any circumstances that necessitate continued use of the desk beyond the occupant’s end-date. Examples include: contract extension, extension to studies, change of role from PGR to PDRA.|

# Process for PDRAs

|4.1|The Line Manager completes the relevant online desk request form giving a minimum of two weeks’ notice.|
|---|---|
|4.2|Local operations team review availability in the requested area and allocate a desk in line with the principles outlined above.|
|4.3|Local operations teams email Line Manager approximately one month in advance of the contract end date to prompt and advise on vacating the desk.|
|4.4|Line Managers email their local operations team to inform of any change to the contract.|
# Process for Academic Offices

5.1 Academic desk allocations are the responsibility of the Research Group Lead/Division Lead with support from their local DSOM.
