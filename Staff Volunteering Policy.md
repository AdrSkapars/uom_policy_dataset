# The University of Manchester Volunteering Policy

# 1 Introduction

1.1 The University recognises that volunteering can be good for the individual, the community and the organisation. It can give staff an opportunity to make a difference whilst developing new skills. Social Responsibility is one of the University’s three strategic goals, and volunteering can play a role in supporting this goal.

1.2 This policy sets out the University’s approach to providing time off for staff to engage in volunteering that supports our goals and activities.

# 2 Scope

2.1 This policy applies to all members of staff.

2.2 This policy is non-contractual and can be amended at any time.

# 3 Roles and Responsibilities

3.1 It is the responsibility of managers to review any requests for volunteering and balance these against operational requirements when determining if requests can be approved.

3.2 It is the responsibility of members of staff to request time off to undertake volunteering activity in accordance with this policy, and ensure that volunteering does not impact upon their other duties and responsibilities for the University.
# General Principles

University Related Volunteering⦁ The University will support a reasonable amount of volunteering where that volunteering is directly related to University programmes, activities or strategic aims such as those indicated on this list. http://www.socialresponsibility.manchester.ac.uk/get-involved/staff/ Time taken will be normally be paid.⦁ Time off for volunteering will include the existing school governor scheme, joining teams like Green Impact, Living Campus, harassment advisors, internal mediation, Sustainability or Wellbeing Champions or other initiatives as the University or specific faculties / departments may launch from time to time.⦁ The amount of time provided will be at the discretion of the manager taking into account operational requirements. Time off for these activities must always be agreed in advance between the member of staff and their manager.

Non-University Related Volunteering⦁ The University will not provide paid leave for other, non-University related activity such as supporting recognised charities or undertaking community activities (other than those types of leave already prescribed under the Public Duties Policy) and staff should take annual leave for these activities. Staff may also request unpaid leave.⦁ Whether leave can be accommodated (and the amount of this leave) will be at the discretion of the manager taking into account operational requirements and any potential benefits for the University. Requests for annual leave will be dealt with in accordance with normal rules for the relevant department. Time for volunteering must always be agreed in advance between the member of staff and their manager. Before granting unpaid leave, managers may require information relating to the proposed activity.
# Requests for volunteering

Staff should discuss their request for time off to undertake volunteering with their manager, outlining the activity they wish to support and the time commitment, along with any potential benefits that they identify.

The manager should review the request taking into account any operational impact, the potential benefits to the University or the individual and their colleagues and the time commitment required.

The manager will have discretion over whether the volunteering can be supported and the time that can be provided, and will confirm the decision to the individual. They may take advice from their HR Partner.

Where the volunteering cannot be supported for operational reasons, the member of staff may make a further request after six months.

Where staff wish to undertake long-term volunteering that is not related to University activities or programmes, they may make a flexible working request under the Flexible Working Policy. This will be subject to the terms set out in that policy.
