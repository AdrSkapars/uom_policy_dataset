# 1. Introduction

What is IP?

1.1. IP is something that you create using your mind (e.g. a story, an invention, an artistic work or a symbol).

1.2. IPRs are legal rights which enable the owners of IP to control and benefit from the use of their IP, usually for a prescribed period of time. The type of IPR depends upon the form of IP. Whilst some IPRs arise automatically upon creation of a work (e.g. copyright), others are only granted following successful registration (e.g. a patent). Any subsequent reference to IP in this Policy means IP and any IPRs therein.

1.3. During the course of their programme of study, employment and/or appointment at the University, it is likely that Students and Employees will create, make and/or develop IP.

1.4. As a general rule, a Creator usually owns any IP in their work, unless:

1.4.1. the IP was made during the course of their employment;

1.4.2. there is an agreement to the contrary; or

1.4.3. any other exception applies (as set out at paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3).

1.5. Like any form of property, IP may have commercial value and can be traded. The IP owner could, for example, authorise (i.e. license) another party to use their IP for a particular purpose, sell or otherwise transfer (i.e. assign) IP to another party.

1.6. The University, Students and Employees must respect, and avoid infringing, IP rights belonging to others.

Purpose

1.7. This Policy provides a framework for the identification, ownership, protection and commercialisation of IP created, made and/or developed by Students and/or Employees.

Aims

1.8. The University aims to:

1.8.1. foster an IP-aware and enterprising culture;

1.8.2. identify, protect and commercialise IP in a timely manner (where appropriate);

1.8.3. recognise Creators and share with them the rewards derived from the successful commercialisation of IP; and

1.8.4. strike a balance between the often competing interests of Creator(s), the University and the wider public.

1 August 2021 Page 4 of 24
# Intellectual Property Policy

4.2. Where IP belongs to the University (including where a Creator has assigned to the University IP which they created, made and/or developed), the Creator may perform any act consistent with the licence granted by the University under paragraph 4.3.2.

The University’s right to use IP

4.3. Where IP belongs to the University (including where a Creator has assigned to the University IP which they created, made and/or developed), the University:

- 4.3.1. may control the use, management and/or commercialisation of, or perform any other action(s) consistent with ownership of, such IP (subject to any wider legal constraints); and
- 4.3.2. grants to the Creator(s) of such IP, a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to retain, use, copy, modify, broadcast and make available (whether in hard copy or electronically) such IP for the purpose, and during the course, of their programme of study or employment at the University (as appropriate) only, but not for any commercial purpose (unless with the University’s prior written consent).

4.4. Where IP belongs to a Creator (including where the University has assigned IP to a Creator), the University may perform any act consistent with the licence granted by the Creator under paragraph 4.1.2.

Moral rights

4.5. To the extent that any moral rights (e.g. the right to be identified as the author or director, the right to object to derogatory treatment and/or the right not to suffer false attribution) exist in any copyright work which belongs to the University, the University will not generally require the relevant Creator to waive any of their moral rights, unless set out in a separate agreement.

4.6. The University will acknowledge the author of a work where the law requires or otherwise, where reasonably practicable.

Performers’ rights

4.7. Performers rights may arise, for example, where an Employee has delivered a taught session or a Student has delivered live a dramatic or musical performance, a reading or recitation of a literary work, or a performance of a variety act or any similar presentation.

4.8. To the extent that performers’ rights or associated rights arise in relation to any IP, the relevant rights-holder consents to the making and use of the IP for the purposes set out in this Policy, with effect from the date of creation.

# Intellectual Property Policy

# 6. Scholarly Materials

General6.1. The University recognises and encourages the right of Students and/or Employees to publish their Scholarly Materials.Rights in Scholarly Materials6.2. Ownership of Scholarly Materials created, made and/or developed by a Student and/or an Employee during the course of their programme of study or employment at the University (as appropriate) shall be determined in accordance with the normal rules set out at paragraphs 3.1 and 3.3 respectively and the rights set out at section 4 shall continue to apply.6.3. For the reason set out at paragraph 6.1, the University will not assert its right under paragraph 4.3.1 to control the use, management and/or commercialisation of, or perform any other action(s) consistent with ownership in relation to, copyright in Scholarly Materials which belong to the University.6.4. Nevertheless, before taking any action in relation to copyright in Scholarly Materials which belong to the University, the Creator must ensure that the relevant Scholarly Materials do not include any other IP which belongs to the University. If in any doubt, the Creator should refer to paragraphs 3.7 to 3.9.6.5. For the avoidance of doubt, the University has not waived any other rights in Scholarly Materials which belong to the University.Deposit of Scholarly Materials with the University’s repository6.6. Creators must within one month of the creation of any Scholarly Materials, archive a full text version in the University’s repository.

# 7. General provisions which apply to all Creators

General7.1. Creators must take all reasonable steps to ensure that any IP which they create, make and/or develop which has (or may have) commercial and/or development potential is properly identified and fully disclosed to the University (in any format that the University reasonably requires) in a timely manner.Maintaining appropriate records7.2. Creators must keep clear and accurate records in relation to any IP which they create, make and/or develop.7.3. Creators should therefore ensure that all (copy and original) works, notes, reports, drawings, lab books, etc. are:7.3.1. dated;7.3.2. sufficiently detailed to identify the work and how it operates (where applicable); and7.3.3. kept in a safe location.Confidentiality7.4. Maintaining confidentiality is essential, as any disclosure of Confidential Information may harm the commercial position of its owner(s) (whether that be the Creator, the University and/or a Third Party) and in certain circumstances, may prevent them from securing appropriate IP protection.7.5. All parties must therefore at all times:

1 August 2021 Page 6 of 24
# Intellectual Property Policy

7.5.1. keep confidential any Confidential Information to which they have (and/or have had) access;

7.5.2. only use Confidential Information for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied; and

7.5.3. ensure that they do not (whether accidentally or otherwise) disclose Confidential Information to any other party.

7.6. Any breach of paragraph 7.5, may result in serious consequences, including action being taken by the University under the relevant disciplinary procedures.

Conflicts of Interest

7.7. Each Creator must, as soon as reasonably practicable, report any actual or potential Conflict of Interest regarding IP and any related activities to their Academic Advisor or Authoriser (as appropriate).

7.8. The Academic Advisor or Authoriser (as appropriate) will determine, normally within 5 working days of any report under paragraph 7.7, whether any actual or potential Conflict of Interest should be referred to the Associate Vice-President with responsibility for IP (or their nominee), whose decision in this regard shall be final.

7.9. Any failure to inform the University of any actual or potential Conflict of Interest in accordance with paragraph 7.7 may result in action being taken under the relevant University disciplinary procedure.

Working with the University

7.10. Each Creator shall provide all reasonable assistance to the University in the identification, protection and/or commercialisation of IP and shall collaborate with all other relevant parties.

7.11. Each Creator shall complete any document which the University reasonably requests, for example, in order to:

- 7.11.1. disclose to the University any IP which they created, made and/or developed;
- 7.11.2. confirm IP creatorship and/or ownership;
- 7.11.3. properly transfer (i.e. assign) to the University any right, title and/or interest they may have in any IP; or
- 7.11.4. make the University aware of any Third Party contribution (whether financial, intellectual, resources or otherwise) to the relevant IP.

7.12. If any Student and/or Employee fails to complete any document which the University reasonably requests pursuant to paragraph 7.10, the University may take action against them under the relevant disciplinary procedure.

7.13. The University will (normally via Innovation Factory) ensure that the Creator(s) are informed about the progress of, and are involved in, the commercialisation of any IP which they create, make and/or develop (as appropriate).

Expiry of licences upon leaving the University and other provisions affecting leavers

7.14. Any licence granted by the University to any Creator(s) to use IP which belongs to the University pursuant to paragraph 4.3.2 will terminate automatically with effect from the date upon which the Creator’s programme of study or employment (as appropriate) at the University ends, subject to any contrary written agreement between the parties.

7.15. On request, and in any event, before ceasing to be a Student and/or an Employee (as applicable), each Creator must deposit with their Head of Department any IP (or, if not possible, associated documents such as drawings, diagrams, recorded know-how (e.g. laboratory notebooks and Tangible Research Materials)) created, made and/or developed by them which belongs to the University.

# Intellectual Property Policy

# 7.16. Former Students and former Employees

Former Students and former Employees will continue to be bound by this Policy in relation to IP which belongs to the University (including where a Creator has assigned to the University IP which they created, made and/or developed).

# 8. Additional provisions for Students

Where IP created, made and/or developed by a Student is assigned to the University, the revenue sharing provisions set out at section 11 will apply to the Student as if they were an Employee.

# 9. Additional provisions for Employees

# New Employees

9.1. Neither Employees nor the University automatically own IP in any works (including Teaching Materials) created, made and/or developed by an Employee during their previous employment.

9.2. Employees must not use any IP during the course of their employment which may potentially infringe the rights of any other party (e.g. a previous employer) unless they have first obtained in writing all relevant consents.

# Leaving Employees

9.3. Once their employment with the University ends (for whatever reason), Employees will not be automatically entitled to use any IP which they created, made, developed and/or used at the University, unless they have first obtained in writing all relevant consents.

9.4. Notwithstanding paragraph 9.3, an Employee may make and retain a single print copy of any Teaching Materials created, made and/or developed by them during the course of their employment with the University for their personal use and/or for non-commercial academic and research purposes only. For the avoidance of doubt, Employees must not use any such Teaching Materials during any subsequent employment, unless they have first obtained in writing all relevant consents.

9.5. Subject to any contrary agreement, cessation of employment with the University shall not normally affect an individual’s right to receive a share of income in accordance with section 11.

# Professional or honorary appointments to the University

9.6. Subject to any contrary agreement, where an individual has a professional or honorary appointment with the University, they must adhere to, and will be treated under, this Policy as if they were an Employee.

# 10. Commercialising IP

10.1. If the Creator(s) wishes to commercialise IP which they created, made and/or developed, they must:

- 10.1.1. explore the possibility of commercialising that IP with the University (through Innovation Factory), in accordance with the procedure set out at Appendix A; and/or
- 10.1.2. do so, in accordance with the procedure set out at Appendix B.

10.2. Although the interests of the University and Creators will often coincide, Creators are advised to seek independent advice, which will normally be at their own cost.

# 11. Revenue sharing

# General

11.1. Any income generated by the commercialisation of IP pursuant to the procedure set out at Appendix A shall belong to the University.

11.2. However, in the interests of encouraging the creation, development and identification of IP, the University will give due consideration to offering incentives to Creator(s) as appropriate.

1 August 2021

# Intellectual Property Policy

11.3.
The University will normally grant Creator(s) a share of any NET IP Revenue generated by the commercialisation of IP, in accordance with this section 11.

# Distribution of NET IP Revenue

|11.4.|Normally, the University will:|
|---|---|
| |1. allocate 40% of the Net IP Revenue to the Creator(s) (the “Creator’s Revenue Share”); and
2. retain 60% of the Net IP Revenue (the “University Revenue Share”), subject at all times to the exceptions detailed at paragraph 11.5.2
|

11.5. Paragraph 11.4 will not normally apply in the case of:

1. Professional Appointments;
2. Teaching Materials, save as where paragraph 5.2 applies;
3. any payment made by a Third Party for any Tangible Research Material (other than a payment in relation to IP comprised within the Tangible Research Material), in which case, the Creator’s Revenue Share will be distributed into a research account for the School which produced the Tangible Research Material, subject to any prior written agreement; or
4. any Spin-Out Company or Student Start-Up Company, as set out at paragraphs 12.3 to 12.10.

11.6. The University will normally only seek to retain a higher University Revenue Share than that set out at paragraph 11.4.2 where the University has provided cash investment, a convertible loan and/or extended services.

11.7. Where IP commercialised by the University is owned (either in full or in part) and/or funded by a Third Party, the revenue sharing provisions set out at this section 11 shall be subject to any relevant agreement with, or obligation owed to, a Third Party.

# No University or Innovation Factory liability

11.8. Neither the University nor Innovation Factory will accept any liability to any Creator(s) if the Creator(s) consider that the return achieved in relation to any commercialised IP is not the best financial return which could have been achieved.

# Distribution of the Creator’s Revenue Share

11.9. Subject to any contrary written agreement between all of the Creators (which must be notified in writing to Innovation Factory), where there is more than one Creator, the default position is that each Creator shall be entitled to an equal proportion of the Creator’s Revenue Share set out at paragraph 11.4.1.

11.10. Any dispute between Creators regarding the distribution of the Creator’s Revenue Share shall be referred for consideration under the dispute resolution procedure set out at section 17. No payments shall be made pending the outcome of that procedure.

11.11. Contributors are not normally entitled to any direct share of NET IP Revenue. However, the Creator(s) may, at their discretion, allocate some of the Creator’s Revenue Share to one or more Contributor(s), subject to the agreement of all of the Creators (which must be notified in writing to Innovation Factory).

Where the relevant IP was disclosed to the University between 1 August 2019 and 31 July 2021 (inclusive), normally, the Creator’s Revenue Share will be 70% and the University Revenue Share will be 30%.

1 August 2021

12.2. The University may (at its discretion) give consideration to the allocation of equity in a Spin-Out Company or a Student Start-Up Company where revenue sharing may not be available or appropriate.

# Division of equity

| |Spin-Out Company|Student Start-Up Company|
|---|---|---|
|Creator’s Equity Share|50%|70%|
|University Equity Share|35%|15%|
|Performance-based share option pool|15%|15%|

of the Creator’s Equity Share to one or more Contributor(s), subject to the agreement of all of the Creators (which must be notified in writing to Innovation Factory).

12.9. Prior to any allotment of shares in a Spin-Out Company or Student Start-Up Company to a Creator or a Contributor, the Creator or Contributor (as appropriate) must provide to the University the items detailed at paragraphs 3.2.1 to 3.2.3 of Appendix A (as appropriate).

12.10. Each party is entitled to retain the share sale proceeds, dividends and/or any other financial benefit derived from their equity in a Spin-Out Company or Student Start-Up Company (as appropriate).

- 13.1.2. any assignment of IP to a Spin-Out Company or Student Start-Up Company shall be conditional on the assignee(s) having first paid to the University and/or Innovation Factory in full any patent expenses reasonably incurred by the University and/or Innovation Factory (as appropriate) as at the date of assignment;
- 13.1.3. any patent expenses reasonably incurred by the University and/or Innovation Factory (as appropriate) as at the date of grant of any commercial licence by the University shall be recoverable as a prior deduction from any Gross IP Revenue generated in relation to the relevant IP.

# Open Licensing

14.1. The University recognises that protection and/or commercialisation of IP may not always be appropriate and that in some circumstances it is normal academic practice to Openly License IP.

14.2. If, having regard to all the circumstances (including their obligations under paragraph 7.1), a Creator considers that any copyright work which they have created, made and/or developed in furtherance of academic research (and excluding Teaching Materials) should be Openly Licensed, the Creator may Openly License that copyright work using a recognised Open Licensing resource (e.g. Creative Commons), selecting the appropriate permissible use(s).

14.3. If in any doubt about the ownership or potential value of any IP being considered under paragraph 14.2, the Creator should refer to paragraphs 3.7 to 3.9.

# Respecting the IP of others

General

15.1. Students and Employees must respect, and must not knowingly or recklessly do any act which would infringe, IP which belongs to any other party.

Using IP which belongs to any other party

15.2. Where a Student and/or an Employee intends to use IP which belongs to any other party (including the University), prior to any such use, they must ensure that (where appropriate):

- 15.2.1. the intended use is authorised by the terms of a collective (or blanket) copyright licence (e.g. a CLA (Copyright Licensing Agency) licence or ERA (Educational Recording Agency) licence);

1 August 2021 Page 11 of 24
# Intellectual Property Policy

15.2.2. the intended use falls within one of the statutory exceptions to copyright;4 or

15.2.3. they obtain the written permission of the relevant rights-holder to the intended use (either in a formal licence or otherwise).

15.3. Where Students and/or Employees determine that paragraph 15.2.1 or 15.2.2 applies, they should:

15.3.1. document their assessment and the reasons for it; and

15.3.2. comply with the requirements of that licence and/or statutory exception (as appropriate).

15.4. Students and/or Employees must not use any IP which belongs to any other party unless paragraph 15.2.1, 15.2.2 or 15.2.3 applies. Any failure to comply with this paragraph 15.4 may constitute IP infringement.

Requests to use IP which belongs to the University
