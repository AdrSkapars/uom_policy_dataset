# Data Protection Policy

# 1 Introduction

This Policy forms part of a suite of policies and procedures that support an information governance framework.

The University needs to hold and to process large amounts of personal data about its students, employees, applicants, alumni, contractors and other individuals in order to carry out its business and organisational functions.

UK data protection law (UK GDPR plus the Data Protection Act 2018) defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. This information is often referred to as person identifying information (PII) by the University and for the purposes of this Policy should be considered to have the same meaning as personal data as defined by the legislation.

# 2 Purpose

Compliance with legislation will be achieved through the implementation of controls and responsibilities including measures to ensure that:

|2.1|personal data is processed lawfully, fairly and transparently. This includes the provision of appropriate information to individuals upon collection of their data by the University in the form of privacy or data collection notices. The University must also have a legal basis to process personal data.|
|---|---|
|2.2|personal data is processed only for the purposes for which it was collected;|
|2.3|personal data is adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purposes for which it was collected;|
|2.4|personal data is accurate and where necessary kept up to date;|
|2.5|personal data is not kept for longer than necessary;|
|2.6|personal data is processed in accordance with integrity and confidentiality principles; this includes physical and organisational measures to ensure that personal data, both manual and digital, are subject to an appropriate level of security when stored, used and communicated by the University, in order to protect against unlawful or malicious processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage. It also includes measures to ensure that personal data transferred to or otherwise shared with, or disclosed to third-parties have appropriate contractual provisions and/or safeguards applied to maintain compliance with data protection law;|
|2.7|personal data is processed in accordance with the rights of individuals, where applicable. These rights are: - the right to be informed;
- the right of access to the information held about them by the University (through a subject access request);
- the right to rectification;
- the right to erase;
- the right to restrict processing;
- the right to data portability;
- the right to object; and
- rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling;

# 2.8 The design and implementation of University systems and processes must make provision for the security and privacy of personal data, including a Data Protection Impact Assessment;

# 2.9 Personal data will not be transferred outside of the UK without the appropriate safeguards in place

# 2.10 Additional conditions and safeguards must be applied to ensure that more sensitive personal data (defined as Special Category data in the legislation), is handled appropriately by the University. Special category personal data is personal data relating to an individual’s:

race or ethnic origin;political opinions;religious or philosophical beliefs;trade union membership;genetic data;biometric data (where used for identification purposes);health; orsex life or sexual orientation.

In addition, similar extra conditions and safeguards also apply to the processing of the personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences.

# 3 Scope

This Policy applies to:

- all personal data held and processed by the University. This includes expressions of opinion about the individual and of the intentions of the University in respect of that individual. It includes data held in any system or format, whether electronic or manual;
- all members of staff, as well as individuals conducting work at or for the University and/or its subsidiaries, who have access to University information (“staff”). This includes temporary, honorary, visiting, casual, voluntary and agency workers, students employed by the University and suppliers (this list is not intended to be exhaustive); and
- all locations from which personal data is accessed including off-campus.

# 4 Responsibilities and compliance framework

All staff and other approved users of University systems must:

- complete data protection training every two years, and must seek advice and guidance from the Information Governance Office if clarification is required; and
- immediately report to the Information Governance Office any actual or suspected misuse, unauthorised disclosure or exposure of personal data, “near misses” or working practices which jeopardise the security of personal data held by the University.

Deans, Heads of School and Directors are responsible for ensuring that personal data within their areas is processed in line with this Policy and established procedures. To assist with this the University has identified Information Governance Guardians (IGGs) across all organisational units, areas and schools. Heads of School and Directors are also responsible for ensuring that there are an appropriate number of IGGs in their areas.

IGGs are responsible for overseeing data protection compliance in their areas, for providing a local point of contact for data protection issues, for identifying local training needs and arranging for them to be met and for disseminating advice and guidance from the Information Governance Office, including the Data Protection Officer. IGGs are also responsible for helping to identify circumstances where data sharing or transfer agreements are needed with third parties, and ensuring that these are put in place.

The Information Governance Office is responsible for providing procedures, guidance and advice in support of this policy and for training staff.
# The Data Protection Officer

The Data Protection Officer is responsible for overseeing the University’s compliance with the data protection legislation.

Staff must note that any breach of this Policy may be treated as misconduct under the University’s relevant disciplinary procedures and could lead to disciplinary action or sanctions. Serious breaches of this Policy may constitute gross misconduct and lead to summary dismissal or termination of contract.

# Monitoring compliance

This Policy and its implementation are subject to internal monitoring and auditing throughout the University, and the outcomes from these processes will inform and improve practices as part of a commitment to continual improvement. The University will also undertake appropriate benchmarking and may be audited by external bodies.

Reports on matters related to this Policy will be provided to the Information Governance Committee.

# Review of Policy

This Policy will be reviewed at least annually or when significant changes are required.
