# Part 2: Organisation

I have delegated to my Directors and Directors of Faculty Operations (DoFOs) the responsibility for managing health and safety in their own areas, in compliance with the University’s health and safety policy.

[See organisation chart in Appendix 1]

# Part 3: Arrangements

Assurance and accountability

I require all Professional Services (PS) Directorates to achieve excellent standards of health and safety (H&S) management.

My Directors and Directors of Faculty Operations (DoFOs) will report on pertinent matters of health and safety in their own areas at the PS leadership team meeting on a quarterly basis.

I require each Directorate to assess their H&S management using the Self-Assessment Tool (SAT) developed from HASMAP. PS staff should be included in the assessment for the Faculties.

Each Directorate is required to complete an annual health and safety monitoring report (AMR) which encompasses a systematic analysis of H&S performance and plans for continuous improvement. The AMR is submitted to the University’s Occupational Health and Safety Advisory Group, as part of the mechanisms for senior managers to provide assurance regarding their management of H&S.

Competent persons

Provision of competent specialist advice is available from Local Safety Advisors, First Aiders, Display Screen Assessors and Fire Evacuation Marshals within the

Directorates in the first instance. If necessary further advice can be sought from Safety Services, Occupational Health and Human Resources as appropriate.

Health and safety management

Delegation of H&S responsibilities for all senior managers within the University are detailed in the University’s Health & Safety policy.

Some staff have specific delegated health and safety responsibilities, these are detailed in the University arrangements chapters.

Each senior manager will develop and implement their own arrangements for health and safety management, appropriate to and in proportion to the risks they work with. These arrangements should be developed and will normally include (but are not limited to):

- planning for health and safety
- continuous improvement in health and safety
- ensuring adequate resources
- competence in health and safety
- co-operation, communication and managing across boundaries
- general requirements as contained in University’s Health & Safety Arrangements Chapter 13

The arrangements should also include how local areas assist the RSCOO in fulfilling his commitments in Part 1 of this Policy.

This policy will be reviewed every two years in consultation with PS leadership team and University Safety Representatives and revised as appropriate, it will be brought to the attention of all staff. The current version will be maintained on the intranet.

Roles and responsibilities

Staff

All PS staff must take reasonable care of themselves and all others who may be affected by their acts and omissions, and comply with both the University’s policy and local policies and arrangements for safe working.

The Registrar, Secretary and Chief Operating Officer (RSCOO)

Communications

Directors will be expected to report quarterly on aspects of health, safety and wellbeing to PSLT meeting and receiving briefings via PSLT.

Senior managers should develop local health and safety communications, including via team meetings as well as other established formal and informal means.

Except in the Directorate of Estates & Facilities and the Directorate for the Student Experience, communications from the University Safety Co-ordinator for Professional Services, for Local Safety Advisors in Professional Services is via a Health and Safety Forum. The purpose of the forum is to disseminate information on matters of H&S and to assist in local safety advisors with aspects of H&S at work.

All staff are encouraged to communicate with their line managers regarding any concerns regarding their own or others health, safety and well-being, either on a one-to-one basis or in team meetings and P&DRs. Managers are expected to respond in a suitable manner and to escalate the matter of concern up the management chain (including the Director of C&R) if unable to reach a satisfactory solution.
