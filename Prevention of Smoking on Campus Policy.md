# Prevention of Smoking on Campus

1.1 As an educational establishment and a good employer, The University of Manchester aims to provide a clean, comfortable and healthy environment for staff and students. Under the provisions of the Health Act 2006, the University has a legal duty to ensure that the working environment is smoke-free. Therefore, all University workplaces and vehicles are designated as non-smoking.

1.2 Guidance from the HSE is that the University is obliged to give priority to non-smokers who do not wish to breathe tobacco smoke. To this end, smokers will not be permitted to smoke within a five-meter radius of the entrance to a building.

1.3 For the purposes of this policy, electronic cigarettes (“e-Cigarettes”) are included as if they were cigarettes.

1.4 Disciplinary action may be taken in the event of contravention of this policy by staff or students.

1.5 The University will provide assistance to those who wish to stop smoking through the Occupational Health Service and Counselling facilities.
