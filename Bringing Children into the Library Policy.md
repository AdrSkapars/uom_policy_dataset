Bringing children into the Library

The Universityâ€™s Safeguarding Children Policy and Guidance recommends that in instances where bringing children on to campus is unavoidable, parents or guardians must be aware of the need for close supervision at all times.

At the University of Manchester Library we recognise that for students who are also parents or guardians it is sometimes necessary for you to bring your children with you when making essential use of the library.

To ensure a safe and secure environment for you and your child we ask that you ensure your children are closely supervised at all times. We also ask that you make every effort help us maintain an appropriate study environment and ensure that other customers are not disturbed.

If you experience any difficulties please do not hesitate to approach a member of staff, who will do their best to help you get what you need from your visit to the library. Please be aware that staff may have to ask you to leave if they feel that your children are causing a disturbance or are not adequately supervised.

Further guidance for student parents is published by the Directorate of the Student Experience and can be found at: https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/supporting-students/student-parents/

This policy applies to all University of Manchester Library sites except The John Rylands Library where children are normally present as visitors.
