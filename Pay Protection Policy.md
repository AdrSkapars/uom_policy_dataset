# Pay Protection Policy

1. Eligibility

The University recognises the value of retaining staff skills and experience in achieving its strategic plans and academic goals and aims to ensure as far as possible by careful forward planning, the security of employment for all its employees. It is committed to maintaining employment practices which promote and enhance the principles of security and diversity of employment as outlined in the Security of Employment Policy.

It is recognised that there may be circumstances which may affect staffing needs and where this makes it necessary to seek to redeploy staff into suitable alternative vacancies elsewhere, this will be managed in accordance with the University’s Redeployment Policy. Redeployment to a suitable alternative vacancy will normally be determined in accordance with a number of factors, which may include employees’ transferrable skills and experience along with their current grade, remuneration, hours and terms and conditions of employment.

There may, however, be extremely rare circumstances in which it is not possible to secure an alternative role on a comparable basis. In such circumstances, it will be at the University’s discretion to agree whether or not the affected employee moves to a lower graded position, but once such a move has been agreed pay protection will be granted automatically.

Written approval must be obtained in advance of any applications for vacancies for lower graded positions. Consideration of the circumstances and approval for the awarding of pay protection will be the responsibility of the appropriate Faculty Head of Human Resources/Head of Central Human Resources in consultation with the appropriate senior manager. Any decision will take into account a number of factors including, but not limited to, the following:

- the number and type of roles the employee has applied for since being designated a redeployee,
- the availability of suitable vacancies at the substantive grade,
- the knowledge, skills and experience of the employee,
- any development activities undertaken by the employee to increase their transferrable skills.

Where pay protection has not been approved by the appropriate Faculty Head of Human Resources/Head of Central Human Resources, individuals will have the right to seek a review of the decision by the Director of Human Resources. All requests for a review must be made in writing, giving details of why they feel the decision is wrong, to the Director of HR within 5 working days of receipt of the decision. The Director of Human Resource’s decision will be final.

Where an employee who is “at risk” choses by their own volition to apply for a lower graded vacancy without prior approval and before all opportunities to secure alternative roles on a comparable basis have been exhausted, pay protection will not be awarded should they choose to accept that role.

2. Level of Pay Protection

Pay Protection will only apply where redeployment is to the grade immediately below the employee’s current grade. In this situation, the existing pay rate will be protected for a maximum period of two and a half years as follows:

a) The first 2 years will be at 100% of the difference between the existing pay rate at the date of redeployment and the maximum scale point, excluding contribution points, of the appropriate grade for the post.b) The following 6 months will be at 50% of the difference between the existing pay rate at the date of redeployment and the maximum scale point, excluding contribution points, of the appropriate grade for the post.

When moving to a new role at a lower grade involving more hours, pay protection will only be applied for the same number of hours as the previous post.

Incremental progression will not be awarded to the protected pay. However, protection will include any general cost of living increases awarded during the agreed period of pay protection.

3. Termination of Pay Protection

At the end of the two and a half year period of pay protection, the employee’s pay will revert to the non-protected rate appropriate to the post at the maximum scale point, excluding contribution points.

If during the period of protection the member of staff, by their own choice, takes up another appointment in the University, protection arrangements will cease and the appointed salary will apply.
