# 5 Discussing Future Plans

5.1 Staff and managers may discuss an individual’s short, medium and long terms plans as part of the P&DR process to enable the University and the member of staff to plan for the future. This may involve discussing provisional retirement plans although there is no obligation on staff to do so.

5.2 Some members of staff who are considering retirement may also want to consider the possibility of a different working pattern or a change of role. Staff can make such a request using the Flexible Working Policy or can explore the option informally with their manager.

5.3 If a member of staff expresses an interest in moving to a more flexible working pattern or, where possible, changing roles, the University will confirm in writing that this is what the individual wants before any action is taken which could affect their employment.

# 6 Giving Notice of Retirement

6.1 If a member of staff has decided to retire, the University requests as much notice as possible. As a minimum the member of staff will be expected to give the University at least the notice period they are required to give under their contract of employment.

# 7 Further Information

7.1 The University is able to offer information and support to assist with planning for retirement. This may include:

- Financial information relating to pension benefits
- Pre-retirement courses
- Mid-career financial planning courses

Further details on all of these can be obtained from the Pensions Office.

# Retirement Policy

8.1 Pre-retirement Leave is intended to support staff in making the transition from work to retirement, therefore it is only available to staff who confirm in writing that they intend to retire from the University and draw their pension. It is not available to any member of staff who is:

- going to draw their pension and return to a different role in the University
- taking flexible retirement (i.e. drawing some earned pension whilst continuing to work for the University).

8.2 Staff retiring at age 55 or over may be entitled to up to a maximum of 6 days pre-retirement leave on the following terms:

- based on length of service, the maximum allowance possible will be one day for each two years of continuous service (at the retirement date) up to a maximum of 6 days
- this will be earned at the rate of one day for each complete month of notice given in writing
- pro rata for part-time staff (based upon the contracted hours at time of retirement)
- cannot be taken in one block
- cannot be used to bring forward the date of retirement
- cannot be exchanged for payment, (i.e. will not be paid in lieu if it has not been taken before the leaving date)
- requests to take pre-retirement leave must be approved by the manager.

8.3 In addition staff retiring at age 55 or over may also take up to a maximum of two days to:

- Attend pre-retirement workshops provided in house by the University (unless they have previously attended a similar course within 2 years of the retirement date)
- Attend appointments with the University Pensions Office

These two days can only be used for the above and cannot be taken as leave. All other appointments, courses, workshops, etc. in preparation for retirement must be taken out of any pre-retirement leave allowance (i.e. the maximum 6 days above) or from the member of staff’s normal annual leave entitlement.

8.4 Application for pre-retirement leave

- Member of staff provides their manager with notice in writing, confirming their retirement date. Manager makes individual aware of pre-retirement leave application form.
- Member of staff completes pre-retirement leave application form and gives to their manager. Manager sends retirement notice letter and application form to HR Services.
