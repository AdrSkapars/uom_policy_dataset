# 1.        POLICY STATEMENT

1.1       We are committed to ensuring high standards of ethics and values. The same
high values applied to research and teaching activities are explicitly extended
to governance and financial transactions.

1.2       It is our policy to conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical manner.
We    take    a   zero-tolerance       approach      to   bribery    and    corruption      and    are
committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our business
dealings     and    relationships      wherever      we    operate     and    implementing        and
enforcing effective systems to counter bribery and corruption.

1.3       We will uphold all laws relevant to countering bribery and corruption in all the
jurisdictions in which we operate. However, we remain bound by the laws of
the UK, including the Bribery Act 2010, in respect of our conduct both at home
and abroad.

1.4       The purpose of this policy is to:

- (a)     set out our responsibilities, and of those working for us, in observing
and upholding our position on bribery and corruption;
- (b)     provide information and guidance to those working for us on how to
recognise and deal with bribery and corruption issues.

1.5       In the UK, bribery and corruption are punishable for individuals by up to ten
years' imprisonment and, if we are found to have taken part in bribery and/or
corruption, we could face an unlimited fine, be excluded from tendering for
public contracts and face damage to our reputation. We therefore take our legal
responsibilities very seriously.

1.6       We have undertaken a risk assessment of our activities considered to be of
greatest risk and this will be reviewed by the University’s Anti-Bribery Officer
on a regular basis.

1.7       In this policy, third party means any individual or organisation staff come into
contact with during the course of their work for us, and includes actual and
potential clients, customers, suppliers, distributors, business contacts, agents,
advisers     and    government         and    public    bodies,      including     their   advisors,
representatives and officials, politicians and political parties.

# 2.        W HO IS COVERED BY THE POLICY?

This policy applies to all individuals working at all levels and grades, including
both academic and Professional Support Services’ staff, senior managers,
officers, directors, employees (whether permanent, fixed-term or temporary).
If you are reading a printed version of this document, you should check https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=17994 to ensure you have the most up to date version.

Consultants, contractors, trainees, seconded staff, home staff, casual staff and agency staff, volunteers, interns, agents, sponsors, or any other person associated with us, or any of our wholly-owned subsidiaries or their employees (except where any such wholly-owned subsidiary has its own anti-corruption and bribery policy), wherever located (collectively referred to as staff in this policy).

# WHAT IS BRIBERY?

A bribe is an inducement or reward offered, promised or provided in order to gain any commercial, contractual, regulatory, personal, business and/or political advantage (advantage).

# GIFTS AND HOSPITALITY

This policy does not prohibit gifts and/or hospitality (given and received) to or from third parties provided that the conditions laid down in this policy are adhered to.

Subject to paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 below, the giving or receipt of gifts and/or hospitality is not prohibited, if the following requirements are met:

- (a) it is not given or received with the intention of influencing to obtain or retain business or an advantage, or to reward the provision or retention of business or an advantage, or in explicit or implicit exchange for favours or benefits;
- (b) it complies with local law; and
- (c) taking into account the reason for the gift and/or hospitality, it is of an appropriate type and value and given at an appropriate time.

We appreciate that the practice of giving business gifts and hospitality varies between countries and regions and what may be normal and acceptable in one region may not be in another. The test to be applied is whether in all the circumstances the gift and/or hospitality is reasonable and justifiable. The intention behind the gift and/or hospitality should always be considered.

# WHAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE?

It is not acceptable for staff (or someone on their behalf) to:

- (a) give, promise to give, or offer, a payment, gift or hospitality with the expectation or hope that an advantage will be received, or to reward an advantage already given;
If you are reading a printed version of this document, you should check https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=17994 to ensure you have the most up to date version.

|(b)|give, promise to give, or offer, a payment, gift or hospitality to a government official, agent or representative, whether to "facilitate" or expedite a routine procedure or otherwise;|
|---|---|
|(c)|accept payment from a third party that staff know or suspect is offered with the expectation that it will obtain an advantage for them;|
|(d)|accept a gift or hospitality from a third party if staff know or suspect that it is offered or provided with an expectation that an advantage will be provided by us in return;|
|(e)|threaten or retaliate against another member of staff who has refused to commit a bribery and corruption offence or who has raised concerns under this policy; and/or|
|(f)|engage in any activity that breaches, or may breach, this policy.|

REGISTER OF INTERESTS

In any event, any gift or hospitality either received or given by employees which has a monetary value of £25 or more should be declared in the local Register of Interests.

See the Financial Regulations and Financial Procedures for further details: https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/DocuInfo.aspx?DocID=1741

FACILITATION PAYMENTS AND KICKBACKS

We do not make, and will not accept, facilitation payments or "kickbacks" of any kind.

Facilitation payments are typically small, unofficial payments made to secure or expedite a routine government action by a government official. They are not commonly paid in the UK, but are common in some other jurisdictions. Kickbacks are typically payments made in return for a business favour or advantage.

If staff are asked to make a payment on our behalf, they should always be mindful of what the payment is for and whether the amount requested is proportionate to the goods or services provided. Staff should always ask for a receipt which details the reason for the payment. If staff have any suspicions, concerns or queries regarding a payment, they should raise these with the University’s Anti-Bribery Officer.

All staff must avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, that a facilitation payment or kickback will be made or accepted by us.

# 8. DONATIONS

No donation must be offered or made on our behalf without the prior approval of the University’s Anti-Bribery Officer. We do not make contributions to political parties.

# 9. RESPONSIBILITIES

# 9.1 Staff must ensure that they read, understand and comply with this policy.

# 9.2 It is the responsibility of all staff to prevent, detect and report bribery and corruption.

# 9.3 Staff must notify their line manager OR the University’s Anti-Bribery Officer as soon as possible if they believe or suspect that a breach of this policy has occurred, or may occur in the future. "Red flags" that may indicate bribery or corruption are set out in the Schedule.

# 9.4 Any employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for gross misconduct. We reserve our right to terminate our contractual relationship with other staff if they breach this policy.

# 10. RECORD-KEEPING

# 10.1 We must keep financial records and have appropriate internal controls in place which will evidence the business reason for making payments to third parties.

# 10.2 Staff must ensure all expenses claims relating to gifts, hospitality and/or expenses incurred to third parties are submitted in accordance with our expenses policy and specifically record the reason for the expenditure.

# 10.3 All accounts, invoices, memoranda and other documents and records relating to dealings with third parties, such as clients, suppliers and business contacts, should be prepared and maintained with strict accuracy and completeness. No accounts must be kept "off-book" to facilitate or conceal improper payments.

# 11. HOW TO RAISE A CONCERN

Staff are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of malpractice at the earliest possible stage. If staff are unsure whether a particular act constitutes bribery or corruption, or if they have any other queries, these should be raised with their line manager or the University’s Anti-Bribery Officer. Concerns may also be reported by following the procedure set out in our Whistleblowing Policy. A copy of our Whistleblowing Policy can be found

https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=28

# 12.       W HAT TO DO IF STAFF ARE OR MAY BE A VICTIM OF BRIBERY OR CORRUPTION

Subject to paragraph 11 above, it is important that staff tell the University’s Anti-
Bribery Officer as soon as possible if they become aware of or are involved in
any activity which constitutes or involves, or may constitute or involve, bribery
or corruption.

# 13.       PROTECTION

13.1      Staff who refuse to accept or offer a bribe, or those who raise concerns or report
another's wrongdoing, are sometimes worried about possible repercussions.
We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine
concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken.

13.2      We are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a
result of refusing to take part in bribery or corruption, or because of reporting in
good faith their suspicion that an actual or potential bribery or corruption
offence has taken place, or may take place in the future.

13.3      Detrimental      treatment    includes     dismissal,    disciplinary    action,    threats   or   other
unfavourable treatment connected with raising a concern. If staff believe that they have
suffered any such treatment, they should inform the University’s Anti-Bribery Officer
or HR colleagues (in the case of employees) immediately. In the case of employees, if
the matter is not remedied, they may raise it formally using our Grievance Procedure,
which can be found on the University intranet’s Policies and Procedures section:
https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=840

# 14.       TRAINING AND COMMUNICATION

14.1      Training on this policy forms part of the induction process for all new staff. As
with many aspects of work, existing staff will receive a level of training to be
determined (on a risk basis)               by their     line manager        through the existing
Performance & Development Review process.

14.2      Our zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption must be communicated
to all suppliers, contractors and business partners at the outset of our business
relationship with them and as appropriate thereafter.

# 15.       W HO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLICY?

15.1      The Board of Governors has overall responsibility for ensuring this policy
complies with our legal and ethical obligations, and that all staff comply with it.
# If  you     are   reading      a   printed     version    of    this   document,       you    should     check
(https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=17994.)                   to  ensure    you   have   the
most up to date version.

# 15.2      The Anti-Bribery Officer (currently Director of Compliance and Risk) has
primary and day-to-day responsibility for implementing this policy, and for
monitoring its use and effectiveness. Management at all levels is responsible
for ensuring those reporting to them are made aware of and understand this
policy.

# 16.       MONITORING AND REVIEW

# 16.1      The    Anti-Bribery     Officer    will   monitor     the   effectiveness       and    review     the
implementation of this policy, regularly considering its suitability, adequacy and
effectiveness. Any improvements identified will be made as soon as possible.
Internal control systems and procedures will be subject to regular audits to
provide assurance that they are effective in countering bribery and corruption.

# 16.2      Staff are invited to comment on this policy and suggest ways in which it might
be improved. Comments, suggestions and queries should be addressed to the
University’s Anti-Bribery Officer.

# 16.3      This policy may be amended at any time.

# Schedule Potential risk scenarios: "red flags"
