# Recruitment and Selection Policy

# 1 Introduction

1.1 The University recognises our people are our most valuable resource and we aim to recruit the brightest and best staff. The purpose of this Policy is to provide a sound framework, based around core principles that are outlined below, to enable us to achieve this aim. The accompanying procedure provides clear guidance on the key stages in recruiting and selecting for a post.

# 2 Scope

2.1 This policy and procedure encompass all activities that form part of the recruitment and selection process. It is applicable to all permanent and fixed term recruitment. However, many of the good practice recommendations should also be applied to casual and temporary recruitment.

2.2 In order for the policy and procedure to be effective it is essential that any member of staff who is involved in any aspect of the recruitment and/or selection is aware of this document and adheres to it. Ultimately it is the responsibility of the senior management in the University in conjunction with Human Resources to ensure that this is the case.

2.3 This Policy does not form part of any contract of employment and may be amended at any time.

# Recruitment and Selection Policy

The University will ensure that the recruitment and selection of staff is conducted in a professional, timely and responsive manner and in compliance with current employment legislation.

The University will provide appropriate training, development, and support to those involved in recruitment and selection activities in order to meet this core principle. Any member of staff involved in recruitment and selection should undertake our mandatory training and comply with the requirements of this policy and procedure. Further details of training requirements can be found on the Staff Learning & Development webpage.

The University will treat all candidates fairly, equitably and efficiently, with respect and courtesy, aiming to ensure that the candidate experience is positive, irrespective of the outcome.

The University will promote best practice in recruitment and selection and will continuously develop its practices to allow new ideas and approaches to be incorporated.

The University will ensure that its recruitment and selection process is cost effective.

# Diversity, Equality and Inclusion

The University is committed to promoting equal opportunities for all and does not discriminate against any applicant on the grounds of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation at any stage of the recruitment process.

Reasonable adjustments for disabled applicants will be made at all stages of the selection process in order to allow them to fully participate. The University participates in the Disability Confident scheme. Disabled candidates will be guaranteed an interview where they meet the essential criteria for the post.

All staff involved in recruitment and selection activity are required to undertake formal training delivered by Staff Learning and Development.

5.4 The University undertakes regular monitoring of equal opportunities data in respect of applications and appointments. Where data analysis indicates improvements may be required, the University commits to taking action to address these, which may include (but isnâ€™t limited to) additional training, changes to policy or process or positive action.

# Recruitment and selection procedure

- There are a number of key stages in recruiting and selecting for a post. This procedure outlines the key stages and provides operating guidelines.
- More detailed advice and guidance is available at StaffNet or on askHR and also by contacting hrservices@manchester.ac.uk or the HR Partners).

# 6.1 Vacancy arises

- When a vacancy first arises, whether this is due to the current post holder moving internally or externally, or a new role, it is important to evaluate carefully the continuing need for the role and in the context of the strategic plan. Consideration should be given to the purpose and content of the role as well as where it fits into the structure of the University. Consideration should also be given to the hours or working patterns required (including if the job can be undertaken flexibly or part time).

# 6.2 Job description and person specification

- A job description and person specification must be produced or updated for any vacant post that is to be filled.
- The job description should accurately reflect all elements of the post.
- The person specification should state both the essential and desirable criteria in terms of skills, aptitudes, knowledge and experience that are required for the job, all of which should be directly related to the job and applied equally to all applicants. Care should be taken when drawing up the person specification to avoid including criteria that may have the effect of indirectly discriminating against certain groups of applicants. Guidance should be sought from the respective HR Partner where needed.

# Recruitment and Selection Policy

In certain circumstances it may be more effective to use a recruitment agency than to advertise externally. Approval to do so should be sought from the HR Partner. This will not however eliminate the need to advertise the position internally.

Further particulars that provide background information pertinent to the job should be produced using the standard template.

All external job advertisements will be published as a minimum on the University website and on jobs.ac.uk. The Recruitment and Resourcing Team in HR Services can provide further information on using other media.

Staff who have been acting-up to a higher grade / on secondment in a position that subsequently becomes vacant will normally have to apply for the position when it is advertised. In such cases the position will normally be advertised to re-deployees and internal candidates only. Each situation will be assessed individually to determine what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Recruiting managers must always take advice from their HR Partner before recruitment commences.

# Managing the Application process

Applicants should complete an online application. If they are unlikely to be able to do so they should contact HR Services regarding alternative arrangements.

Applicants applying online will receive an automated acknowledgement of their application.

Recruiting managers will be given access to the Universityâ€™s online application system in order to view applicants for their vacancy.

Equal opportunities data will be completed online by applicants but not accessible by the Recruiting manager.

The University of Manchester has a legal obligation to comply fully with the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. The University of Manchester policy on the Recruitment and Employment of ex-offenders sets out the steps to be taken in relation to exempted and non-exempted posts.

# 6.7 Short-listing

- All applicants should be assessed against the person specification and should meet, as a minimum, those that have been identified as possible to assess from the initial application. A template is available on Staffnet.
- Those involved in short-listing should only use the evidence provided in the application when assessing the applicant against the criteria and should not use information obtained informally from other sources, e.g. social media (unless the candidate has provided links to professional social media in their application). The same applies at interview/selection stage.
- Short-listing for all posts should be undertaken by a minimum of two people to avoid any possibility of bias, one of whom would normally be the direct line manager. The composition of the panels for academic posts is specified by the University.
- Short-listed candidates should be provided with details of the selection process, including any tests, by email or in writing giving as much prior notice as possible. Providing insufficient notice to applicants could have an adverse impact on public relations. Managers should ask candidates to advise them if there are any particular arrangements or reasonable adjustments that should be made so that they can participate fully in the selection process.
- The closing date for applications will be included with the advert details online. Applications after the closing date will not be accepted.
- Applicants that have not been short-listed will receive an email from HR Services confirming this once HR Services have received notification from the recruiting manager. Recruiting managers are therefore required to contact HRServices@manchester.ac.uk to confirm outcomes at short-list stage as soon as this information is available to ensure timely feedback to unsuccessful applicants.
- Any member of staff involved in a selection process who has a personal or familial relationship with an applicant must bring this to the attention of the HR Partner and the Chair of the selection panel.

# 6.8 Selection

# Recruitment and Selection Policy

It is recommended that a range of selection methods, for assessing both the essential and desirable criteria in the person specification are established in advance of the selection process as this will enhance objective decision making which is difficult through interview alone. Further information on additional selection methods is on StaffNet and HR Partners can provide further advice and guidance in this area.

Interview questions and the structure of the interview should be consistently applied to all candidates and should be based on the person specification although this does not prevent interviewers from asking follow up questions to obtain more detail that is specific to an individual candidate. Further information on interviews and interview questions is available on StaffNet.

Notes recording the salient points of the interview should be taken, so that they can be referred to when assessing candidates against the person specification and making decisions. Notes of the interview and any other notes on the candidate taken during the recruitment and selection process should be kept for a minimum of one year following the selection process by the recruiting manager responsible for the process. In some circumstances these may be required by HR Services if the successful applicant is a non-EEA citizen worker who needs sponsoring by the University.

In the event that a candidate requests feedback about their performance in the selection process this should be provided by the recruiting manager as soon as possible, where requested. Unsuccessful interview candidates should be dealt with courteously and sensitively. The recruiting manager is responsible for contacting candidates after interview to communicate the outcome of the interview and notifying HR Services of the outcome so that the applicant tracking system can be updated.

The Panel should wherever possible reach a consensus on the selection decision. Where there is disagreement amongst a panel as to the successful candidate, the majority view shall prevail.

# References

Information sought from referees should be structured around the requirements of the job and the job description should be provided. It should be noted that many organisations have a policy of not providing personal references and therefore references provided may only confirm

Human Resources 2019
The University of Manchester

# Recruitment and Selection Policy

Details of current appointment. This is much less likely to be the case with references for academic posts which are of a more personal nature.

- A sample reference request letter is available on Staffnet
- For academic posts 3 references will be taken up, normally prior to interview. This is a reflection of established practice and relates to the nature of the references. For non-academic posts 2 references will be taken up. This will normally be after the interview when a verbal offer is made, for reasons of confidentiality, unless the candidate has given explicit approval to take up references prior to interview.
- However, referees must not be contacted in any circumstances if the candidate has not given consent on the application form. Ultimately all offers are subject to satisfactory references and if a candidate is unable to comply with this requirement this could result in the offer of employment being withdrawn.
- The information provided should be treated as confidential and should be used only to verify information collected through the selection process.
- Documents relating to all applicants will be treated with the utmost confidentiality and in accordance with relevant data protection legislation. Personal information relating to candidates will be stored in accordance with the University records retention schedule.

# 6.10 Making the appointment

- It is normal practice for a verbal offer to be made after the interview by the Chair of the selection panel or recruiting manager although they have the discretion to delegate this responsibility.
- In the event that a recruiting manager wishes to appoint above the grade minimum, they should discuss this with their HR Partner and secure appropriate approval.
- Once a selection decision has been made a New Appointment Form should be completed and submitted to hrservices@manchester.ac.uk who will produce a written offer of employment in line with agreed service standards. Offers of employment are subject to satisfactory references and medical clearance and any other checks as appropriate, such as Asylum and Immigration checks, Disclosure and Barring service checks (where eligible).
