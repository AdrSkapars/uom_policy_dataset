# 1. INTRODUCTION

The nature of different opportunities for Visiting Research Students means that the experience of each student attending the University for a short period of time will inevitably differ across the University.

Visiting Research Students can benefit enormously from their time at the University of Manchester, both academically and personally; they can build relationships with other research groups and they can be an ambassador for Manchester in their own institution. Admitting students under this policy can offer a number of opportunities for the University, such as being able to showcase our research capabilities and promote the University in the UK and overseas, and it may lead to reciprocal arrangements for our own students.

There are general administrative and support requirements when admitting Visiting Research Students to the University which must be considered. These responsibilities, including those of the student, are outlined out in the following sections, and this is the policy which students and staff at the University of Manchester should follow.

# 1.1 Aims

This Visiting Research Student policy aims to:

- a) define the criteria for a Visiting Research Student.
- b) provide information on policy and procedural issues at the University of Manchester in relation to the admission, progress and administration of Visiting Research Students.
- c) detail the minimum requirements for the admission process in relation to Visiting Research Students, which will supplement the University Admissions Policy. It is expected that local practice will vary according to discipline and that supplementary guidance may be provided at Faculty and / or School level.
- d) be used by academic and administrative staff and Visiting Research Students.
- e) form part of the University’s Code of Practice for Postgraduate Research Degrees.
- f) provide a framework for admitting and supporting Visiting Research Students during their period of time at the University of Manchester to ensure that visitors are given a positive experience while they are here whilst protecting the reputation and responsibilities of the University by being clear about the expectations of all parties involved.

# 1.2 Definition of a Visiting Research Student

For the purposes of this policy, the term ‘Visiting Research Student’ is applied to students who have the following characteristics:
# Visiting Research Student Policy

October 2019

a) A Visiting Research Student will be registered at another recognised institution in the UK, EU or Overseas on a programme of study with an approved qualification, and whose short term attendance for a defined period of time at the University of Manchester will contribute to their studies.

b) Normally a Visiting Research Student will be wishing to undertake some aspect of research at the University of Manchester.

c) Except where stated otherwise, a Visiting Research Student will be allowed to attend the University of Manchester for a period of no less than one calendar month and normally no more than 12 months.

d) Visiting Research Students are required to adhere to the University of Manchester governance, appropriate regulations, Health and Safety and conduct requirements.

e) Students who are part of a collaborative Centre for Doctoral Training arrangement and students transferring into their last year of study from another institution due to their supervisor transferring to the University of Manchester can be recorded as a Visiting Research Student. Students transferring into their last year of study at the University of Manchester can enrol as a Visiting Research Student at the University of Manchester but will remain registered at their ‘home’ institution and will receive any award from their ‘home’ institution. International students transferring to University of Manchester should seek advice from the Student Immigration Team (visa@manchester.ac.uk).

f) This policy also refers to Visiting Research Exchange Students on a strategic reciprocal arrangement.

# 1.3 Those not accommodated within this policy

The Visiting Research Student route does not accommodate:

- a) staff of the University of Manchester,
- b) current students registered at the University of Manchester,
- c) short term visits from members of staff from external institutions (except where staff status is explicitly for the purpose of study for a PhD),
- d) students or visitors attending the University for the purpose of work experience of any kind,
- e) visitors in any other capacity, such as postdoctoral fellows, those with a ‘Visitor’ status in HR (neither being staff nor a student),
- f) students coming to the University as part of formal arrangements through the International Programmes office.
# Visiting Research Student Policy

# 2. DURATION OF ATTENDANCE AND MODE OF STUDY

The total period of attendance at the University of Manchester will normally be for a period of between 1 to 12 months as part of one visit. Visiting Research Students may apply and be accepted for multiple visits, however, the School has no obligation to accept subsequent applications for visits and due consideration should be given to the purpose of the visit, the research they are undertaking, the duration being requested and visa restrictions. The admitting School will determine the attendance requirements and will confirm these to the student when making an offer of a place. Due consideration should be given to the support requirements of the student, including supervision, pastoral care, monitoring and health and safety requirements, when making the offer of a place.

Due to the nature of a Visiting Research Student’s period of attendance, candidates should normally only be offered on a full-time basis. Requests for part-time study will be granted at the discretion of the host school, and must include an assessment of whether the visiting student’s immigration status permits or precludes part-time study.

# 2.1 The following attendance requirements apply to all Visiting Research Students

- a) Visiting Research Students will normally study on a Full-time basis and are required to be present at the University for the duration of their period of stay.
- b) Visiting Research Students can attend existing taught modules where there is availability, but will normally be solely research focussed.
- c) In exceptional circumstances, Visiting Research Students can apply to extend their stay at the University. The student can apply for an extension for up to 3 months, with the length of stay normally not exceeding 15 months in total which will incur additional pro-rata fees. In exceptional circumstances a Visiting Research Student extension may be granted for longer than 15 months with approval from the Faculty Associate Dean for Graduate Education/ Postgraduate Research.
- d) Visiting Research Students can apply to attend for no longer than 12 months at any one time, unless they are part of a CDT collaborative arrangement in which case they will be required to re-register each year. In exceptional circumstances a Visiting Research Student period of stay may be granted for longer than 12 months with approval from the Faculty Associate Dean for Graduate Education/ Postgraduate Research.
- e) Visiting Research Exchange Students should refer to their Faculty Office contact should they have queries about extending their length of stay beyond the initially agreed period.
# Visiting Research Student Policy

October 2019

f) Students who have transferred for the final part of their programme at the University of Manchester due to their supervisor transferring to this institution can be admitted for more than 12 months and will be required to re-register each year.

g) Applications for an extension to a Visiting Research Student stay and/or multiple visits must be formally approved by the Faculty Associate Dean for Graduate Education/ Postgraduate Research.

h) In exceptional circumstances, where a School or research group has a collaborative arrangement with a peer institution, a student may be allowed to attend for up to one year with approval from the Head of School. In these circumstances, the student will be recorded on Campus Solutions as a ‘Research Partner Student’. The collaborative arrangement must show evidence of strong strategic links with the peer institution, through areas such as research grants, recently published collaborative papers or student exchanges.

# 2.2 The following attendance requirements apply to international Visiting Research Students who require a visa to study in the UK

[Please refer to the immigration scenarios document provided by the Student Immigration Team for further details]

a) Schools must ensure that they have processes in place to monitor the attendance and engagement of any Visiting Research Students attending the University on a Tier 4 visa.

b) Administrators should be using the relevant template provided by the Student Immigration Team for inviting international student visitors: www.saa.manchester.ac.uk/student-immigration/visa/stsv/

c) International research students currently studying at a ‘host’ institution in the UK on a Tier 4 visa, who wish to apply as a Visiting Research Student to study at the University of Manchester, may do so as ‘supplementary study’ while retaining their Tier 4 visa at the ‘host’ institution. They do not need to apply for an additional visa. If the student wishes to do this, they should be encouraged to seek advice from the Student Immigration Team (visa@manchester.ac.uk).

d) Visiting Research Students will not be admitted to the University if they have entered the UK on a general visitor (tourist) visa.

# 2.2.1 International Visiting Research Students attending for less than 6 months

a) Visiting Research Students who require a visa to enter the UK, and who wish to attend for less than 6 months can attend on a Short Term Student visa or apply for a Tier 4 visa. To enable the student to apply for a short term student visa, the host School at the University of Manchester should issue a letter of invitation using the short-term student visa letter template provided by the Student Immigration Team which includes the University of Manchester's sponsor licence number: http://www.saa.manchester.ac.uk/student-immigration/visa/stsv/.

b) Visiting Research Students staying for more than one month and less than 6 months, who are in the UK on a Short Term Student visa cannot extend their stay, change to a different visa category or undertake any work (paid or unpaid).

c) Where it is known at the start that the overall visit will be over 6 months the student must apply for a Tier 4 visa at the start. The student is not permitted to enter on a Short Term Student visa and then return home to obtain a Tier 4 visa for a further 6 months.

# 2.2.2 International Visiting Research Students attending for more than 6 months

a) Visiting Research Students who require a visa to enter the UK and who wish to attend as a Visiting Research Student for between 6 months to 12 months will need to apply for a Tier 4 visa. They will be sponsored by the University of Manchester and will fall under our obligations for Tier 4 monitoring and attendance.

b) Advice for students applying for a Tier 4 visa can be obtained from www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk/immigration-and-visas/study-visa/

# 2.2.3 International Visiting Research Students requiring Academic Technological Approval Scheme (ATAS) Clearance

a) Visiting research students from outside the EEA and studying in certain science and engineering areas may require ATAS clearance from the UK government before any study or research can begin.

b) Where research falls under the ATAS scheme, the requirement for clearance applies to any student who is subject to immigration control.

c) Where a student requires a Tier 4 or short term study visa, ATAS clearance must be obtained before the visa application is submitted. In the case of non-visa nationals, ATAS clearance should be obtained before entry to the UK.

d) Where a student already has a visa that permits study (e.g. a ‘dependant’ visa, Tier 1, Tier 2), ATAS clearance must be obtained before research at the University starts.

e) Where ATAS is a requirement, it is the responsibility of the inviting academic / School to ensure that the student visitor is provided with appropriate information to enable them to submit an application for ATAS clearance.
# Visiting Research Student Policy

October 2019

including agreed research plan and the CAH3 code for their research; and that the student visitor has obtained ATAS clearance before the start of any period of research.

f) For information on ATAS clearance, please contact the Student Immigration Team.

# 3 KEY PRINCIPLES FOR VISITING RESEARCH STUDENTS

# 3.1 Taught Units

Visiting Research Students can attend existing taught modules, but will normally be mainly research focussed.

- a) Visiting Research Students may be given the opportunity to attend existing taught modules as part of their stay, subject to the advice and approval of the supervisor and Programme directors concerned.
- b) Visiting Research Students will not be eligible for credit or any qualification from either the research they undertake or any taught modules they take, unless they are studying on a University of Manchester CDT/DTP collaborative programme.

- b) Enquiries from prospective Visiting Research students can be made informally to supervisors or the school/Faculty PGR office, and students should normally be encouraged to approach a potential supervisor before they make a formal application to attend. Normally a research proposal and CV should be presented to the supervisor to consider the benefit the University and the student will take from the period of attendance. Should a supervisor be confident that the period of attendance will be beneficial for the student and the School involved, the applicant will then be asked to complete the University of Manchester’s online application form or contact the School / Faculty PGR Administrator for further guidance where appropriate.
- c) Students wishing to be considered for a Visiting Research Student period of study must formally apply through the University of Manchester online application form.
- d) Visiting Research Exchange Students, will apply separately through the Exchange application form in the first instance. For further details see: http://www.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/research/postgraduate-research/collaboration/

# e) Applications from Visiting Research Students will need to be approved by the PGR Director / PG tutor within the admitting School.

# f) The Visiting Research Student will be asked to provide a confirmation of study letter from their current institution as part of the application process. The letter must provide written consent from the student’s home institution and confirm that the period of study and research topic is relevant to the student’s current study.

# g) Schools may wish to request further documents from a Visiting Research Student as part of the application process including, but not limited to:

- two academic references,

# 3.6 Research Environment and Resources

Visiting Research Students normally wish to attend the University to engage with experienced academic staff. Visiting Research Students must have appropriate access to facilities and an active research environment for them to undertake their research effectively. Visiting Research Students should have access to appropriate resources such as library facilities, IT facilities and other specialist equipment where appropriate for their research and be encouraged to attend and present their work at seminars.

# 4. FEE ARRANGEMENTS

a) International, UK and EU Visiting Research Students, will be charged the Visiting Student fee as stated in the Student Support microsite.

b) In exceptional circumstances, where students are attending the University for 12 months or more, they will be charged a standard or composite tuition fee as per the relevant Schools’ advertised fee bands.

c) PGR Exchange students on a strategic reciprocal arrangement may not be charged a fee; this will be confirmed in the offer letter to the student.

d) Fees for transferring students (as detailed in section 1.2e) will be calculated by the relevant School and confirmed in the offer letter.

Visiting research partner students (as detailed in section 2.1h), who have been permitted to attend for up to one year will be charged a fee levied with the prior formal approval of the Head of the School concerned. Details of the fee can be found on the Student Finance website.
