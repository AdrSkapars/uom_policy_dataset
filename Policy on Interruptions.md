# 1.0 Introduction and Purpose

1.1 This document sets out the University’s Policy on interruptions to Undergraduate or Postgraduate Taught Programmes of study.

1.2 The Policy is accompanied by the Guidance for Staff on Interruptions to Undergraduate and Postgraduate Taught Programmes and Guidance for Students on Interruptions to Undergraduate and Postgraduate Taught Programmes.

1.3 The purpose of the Policy is to set out the expectations for granting interruptions to taught programmes, to ensure consistency of practice and experience across the University.

# 2.0 Scope and Definitions

2.1 This policy applies to Undergraduate and Postgraduate Taught students across the University and staff members working with them. Students on Degree Apprenticeships, including higher apprenticeships, must refer to the Procedure on Break in Learning for Apprentices.
# General Principles

3.0.1 Schools are responsible for following this policy in order to ensure that student requests for interruptions to a programme of study are handled consistently and students treated equitably. Schools are also responsible for publishing the Guidance for Students on Interruptions to Undergraduate and post Graduate Taught Programmes of Study in Student Handbooks and on the School website.

3.0.2 In the case of students in the UK on a student visa, the University is legally required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) any interruption of studies of over 60 days duration. Therefore, Schools must refer students with a visa to the Student Immigration Team to discuss the consequences of taking an interruption.

3.0.3 A single period of interruption would not normally be for more than a complete year. After a single and continuous period of interruption of 12 months, the student’s circumstances and progression must be reviewed by the School and, following that, an exit award will be issued if appropriate.

3.0.4 Schools must ensure that sufficient measures are put in place to support students returning from interruption, including checking that students are deemed to be fit to return to study, for medical-related interruptions. Please refer to section 3.3 of the Guidance for Staff on Interruptions to Undergraduate and Postgraduate Taught Programmes of Study.

3.0.5 If a student’s application for interruption is declined by their School, the student has a right to appeal against this decision. In this instance, students must be advised to refer to the University’s Academic Appeals Procedure (General Regulation XIX).

3.0.6 There is an expectation that all those involved will, where possible and appropriate, respect the confidentiality of the matters concerned. There may be circumstances in which confidentiality cannot be maintained such as harm to self/others, criminal activity and issues related to Fitness to Practice.

3.0.7 The guidance documents for Staff and Students on Interruptions to Undergraduate and Postgraduate Taught Programmes of Study (see Appendix 3 and Appendix 1 respectively) provides a list of examples of acceptable types of circumstances which may be considered grounds for students applying for an interruption to a programme. Schools can also consider applications for more positive reasons, for example, circumstances that demonstrably enhance a student’s employability.
# 4.0 Monitoring Compliance

4.0.1 Adherence against this document is expected and should be monitored by Heads of Schools (or their delegates) as part of a wider quality assurance process which supports the Annual Academic Assurance Process including, Schools, Faculties, Teaching and Learning Strategy Group, the Academic Quality Sub-Committee for Teaching, Learning and Students, and Senate.

4.0.2 Schools are responsible for referring students with a visa to the Student Immigration Team to discuss the consequences of taking an interruption.

4.0.3 In the case of students in the UK on a student visa, the University is legally required to report to UKVI any interruption of studies of over 60 days duration and Schools are responsible for ensuring this is carried out. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in the University’s Student sponsor licence being revoked.
