# Policy on Submission of Work for Summative Assessment on Taught Programmes

# CONTENTS

# 1. Introduction

1.1 The purpose of this Policy is to provide transparency in relation to the submission of summative assessment and the way the details are articulated to students. It also sets out the responsibilities of Schools regarding penalties for work that is submitted late or exceeds the prescribed length.

# 2. Scope

2.1 This Policy refers to all undergraduate and postgraduate coursework submitted for summative assessment on taught programmes. Summative assessment is defined, for the purposes of this policy, as that which contributes to the final unit mark.

2.2 The Policy does not apply to purely formative assessment. The Policy also does not apply to assessment that students must attend to complete, such as practical tests, written examinations or work which is marked in the presence of students as part of a continuous assessment model.

# 3. Main Principles

3.1 The purpose of this Policy is to ensure that the arrangements and procedures for the submission of work for summative assessment are equitable and transparent.

# 4. The Policy

- Extending deadlines/Disability Advisory Services (DASS) automatic extensions
- Penalty for late submission
- Penalty for going over length
- Plagiarism detection

# 4.1 Schools must publish School level procedures for submission of work for summative assessment, and Faculties will be responsible for ensuring that these are appropriate across the Faculty and in accordance with this policy.

# 4.2 Schools must publish deadlines for the submission of all coursework at the beginning of each semester. Students are responsible for managing their time in order to meet published deadlines; multiple deadlines close together are not grounds for mitigation.

# Extending deadlines/Disability Advisory and Support Services (DASS) automatic extensions

4.3 Deadlines may be extended in accordance with the Policy on Mitigating Circumstances and Coursework Extensions.

4.4 Arrangements for automatic extensions for students registered with the Disability Advisory and Support Services (DASS) must be in accordance with the University's policy.
# Support Service (DASS) Guidelines

The Disability Advisory and Support Service (DASS) guidelines must be adhered to. For more information, refer to the 'Guidance for Automatic Extensions for Disability Advisory and Support Service (DASS) students'.

# Penalty for Late Submission

There is a standard penalty for all late submissions, which must be applied by Schools, especially for large pieces of work such as dissertations or projects. This standard penalty is also applicable to all other pieces of work unless alternative arrangements are approved by the relevant Faculty. Schools need to present a case to their Faculty for any exceptions to the standard penalty, and if approved, any variations must be clearly communicated on each assessment. Faculties should review any variations annually.

Details regarding the standard penalties or any Faculty-approved variations should be communicated to students at the beginning of each semester.

The standard penalty applies to first attempts only. Students submitting referral assignments after the deadline will automatically receive a zero mark. There are no further resit opportunities for late-submitted referred assignments unless there is approved mitigation.

Schools are required to implement a sliding scale penalty system for late submissions, where the mark awarded will progressively reduce for each day or part of a day that the work is late.

The mark deduction is 10% of the maximum available per 24 hours. For example, if the work is marked out of 100, a deduction of 10 marks per 24 hours late would apply. If the work is marked out of 20, the deduction would be 2 marks for each 24 hours late. The penalty starts as soon as the assignment is late, with a 10% deduction for immediate late submission, and further penalties for each subsequent 24 hours of delay.

In exceptional circumstances and for pedagogic reasons, a Unit Lead may choose not to accept late submissions of assessed summative work. Such decisions must be approved by the Faculty and detailed in Unit Specifications, including the rationale and consequences in assignment briefs.

For more information on late submission penalties, refer to the Guidance on Late Submission.

# Penalty for Going Over Length

Schools must establish procedures for handling work that exceeds the required length and communicate them to students at the start of each semester.

Penalties for exceeding the specified length should align with the overarching principles of fairness and transparency.

# Plagiarism Detection

Summative assessed written work, including dissertations and projects, should undergo plagiarism detection where appropriate.

Note: Large pieces of work are defined as single assessed pieces carrying a credit weighting of 30 credits or more.
