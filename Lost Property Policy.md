# THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER LOST PROPERTY POLICY

# 1. Purpose:

To ensure property found on site, or left within University premises is dealt with consistently and in accordance with both internal service standards and the Office of Fair Trading guidance.

# 2. Applicability and Scope:

This policy applies to anybody entering University premises and should be used when property is found or has been left behind. The property may belong to students, staff, their guests, contractors or members of the general public.

# 3. Definitions:

- Lost Property is anything not belonging to the University left on University premises.
- Personal items of value are items left on the premises which contain personal or sensitive information and/or information from which an individual might be identified e.g., Passport, Birth certificate, cheque book, cash or secure container (purse or wallet) likely to contain valuables, Credit/Debit card, Driving Licence, Bank statements, mobile phone / IPad etc. (This is an indicative but not exhaustive list)

# 4. Lost Property:

Property found on University grounds and handed in will be logged by either staff in House Services or the Student Services Centre (whoever it is handed in to). All unclaimed items, which are not personal items of value that can be returned to an originator e.g. the DVLA, will be kept for one month. After this time any item not collected will be disposed of. For security reasons, all bank cards handed in will be securely destroyed immediately.

All staff have a responsibility to hand in any personal items of value which they find on University premises.

Estates staff in conjunction with the Student Services Centre have a responsibility to maintain a log of lost property found and to make every effort to trace the owner. Any personal items of value found will be placed in the secure storage area to await collection for up to a maximum of one month.

# 5. Disposal Policy:

Where possible any items being disposed of will be sent for recycling in support of the University’s sustainability agenda or taken to local charity shops. Where items may contain sensitive data (laptops, phones etc.) they will be disposed of in accordance with the University Policy on the disposal of sensitive data. Due to health and safety, items containing food or drink will be disposed of immediately.

Any cash found and not claimed will be donated to the Student hardship Fund, administered by the Student Services Centre and used to support students in financial hardship.

# 6. Collection of Lost Property:

Anyone wishing to collect lost property needs to arrange this directly with the Student Services Centre.

Small items, if requested by the owner, may be posted. The University will however, not accept any responsibility for items that may be lost in the post. Owners that wish to have items sent by recorded delivery will incur a charge.
# Appendix A

University Lost Property Process:

All items found on University property are to be kept in the buildings they are found in for one week, then given to centralized lost property.

If it is possible to identify the owner, the University will contact the owner via email and, if possible by phone. This contact will be logged on the lost property log and initiated by SSC Staff.

Emails will be sent from a lost property email address, and will include arrangements for collecting property, including opening times and venue.

Anyone who has lost something should email the lost property email to see if their item has been logged (SSC staff monitor this).

If items have been located the owner will be informed about when and where they can collect the items.

Emails received enquiring about lost property will checked daily by a member of the SSC team and SSC staff will also cross check the email account with the lost property spread sheet weekly in order to verify whether an item has already been handed in. There should be an initial response to the email if it is not found stating this and that we will check weekly for one month to see if it is handed in. If after one month the item is not found we will not check further.

Lost student cards are to be sent to the Student Services Centre and staff cards are to be returned to Human Resources.

Items of Personal ID, with the exception of bank cards, will be returned to the appropriate bodies after one month – DVLA, passport office etc. For security reasons bank cards are securely disposed of immediately.

All other items will be kept by centralised lost property for one month, if after this time the property is not collected it should be recycled, sent to a charity shop or destroyed if it contains sensitive data. Any unclaimed monies are to be given to the University Hardship Fund.
