# 1.0 Introduction and Purpose

1.1 This document sets out the University’s policy on additional costs for students on undergraduate and postgraduate taught programmes, over and above their tuition fee.

1.2 The purpose of this policy is to ensure a consistent approach across the University to manage any additional costs for students as part of their programme of study.

1.3 The University must provide transparency in the way additional costs are articulated to students.

# 2.0 Scope and Definitions

2.1 This policy applies to all undergraduate and postgraduate taught students undertaking programmes of study at the University of Manchester, including those taking a placement year. It does not apply to students repeating a year.

2.2 This policy defines additional costs as essential or optional costs that are not included in tuition fees but are necessary for a student to fully participate in their programme.
# General Principles

3.0.1 All students must normally be able to complete their programme of study without having to pay additional study costs over and above the tuition fee for that programme. Any unavoidable additional compulsory costs totalling more than 1% of the annual home undergraduate fee per annum must be made clear at the point of application and in the programme handbooks, with details of what these costs are.

3.0.2 Optional costs must be made clear at the point of application and in the programme handbooks. Where costs are unknown or uncertain, information about how these will be calculated must be set out.

3.0.3 The costs of any compulsory printing (including coursework and course material) must be met by the School, and this is not included in the 1% detailed above.

3.0.4 The expectation across the University is that dissertations must be produced and submitted electronically. Should a School consider online submission inappropriate and require hard copy dissertations, the costs of producing these must be borne by the School, and students must be made aware of the requirement.

3.0.5 Material on reading lists must be made accessible to students via the Library, either digitally or for loan. In order to achieve this, Schools must ensure that lists are submitted to the Library in a timely fashion.

3.0.6 Where membership of a professional body is a requirement of a programme then the costs must be covered by the School for the duration of the programme.

# Other exceptions: Cases where students are required to contribute

3.1.1 Students are required to pay a £100 contribution towards a diagnostic assessment for specific learning difficulties, with the University meeting the rest of the cost.

# Monitoring Compliance

4.0.1 Adherence against this document is expected and should be monitored by Heads of Schools (or their delegates) as part of a wider quality assurance process.
# supports the Annual Academic Assurance Process including, Schools, Faculties, Teaching and Learning Strategy Group, the Academic Quality Sub-Committee for Teaching, Learning and Students, and Senate.

# 4.0.2 The University must comply with the Higher Education: Consumer Law Advice for Providers published by the Competition and Markets Authority or risk being in breach of consumer protection law.
